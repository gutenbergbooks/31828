<h2><a name="TO_THE_PUPIL" id="TO_THE_PUPIL"></a>TO THE PUPIL</h2>


<p>Let me trace the evolution which has led
to the plan of this text-book. A class in
elocution of which you are a member is given
a paragraph from <i>Modern Eloquence</i>, a bit
from an oration or address of Beecher or
Phillips or Beveridge, to study. The passage
appeals to you. You are roused by it to an
eager, new appreciation of courage, conservatism
or of the character of some national
hero. You "look" your interest. You are
asked to go to the platform. You are glad.
You want to repeat the inspired word of the
prophet. You begin confidently to voice the
words of the great orator&mdash;the words which
you had lifted alive from the page&mdash;but in
your voice they sound now formal, cold, lifeless.
You hesitate, your emotion is killed,
your thought inhibited, your eagerness gone,
your impulse dead&mdash;but you have made a
discovery. You have become conscious of
a great need, and your teacher, if she be wise,
has discovered the nature of that need. You
consult together and find three things have
failed you, and, through you, the orator you
wished to interpret. These things are your
mind, your vocabulary, and your voice. You
find that your need is threefold&mdash;it is the
need to feel intelligently and to think vitally
<i>on your feet</i>; the need to acquire a vocal
vocabulary; the need to train your instruments
of expression&mdash;voice and body.</p>

<p>To help you and your teacher to meet
this threefold need is the wish of this
book; and the book's plan is the result of
the author's experience with her own pupils
in watching the evolution of their skill
in vocal expression, the development, along
natural lines, of their ability to speak effectively.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VOCAL_EXPRESSION" id="VOCAL_EXPRESSION"></a>VOCAL EXPRESSION</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The strongest impulse of the human heart
is for self-expression. The simplest form
of expression is speech. Speech is the instinctive
use of a natural instrument, the
voice. The failure to deal justly with this
simple and natural means of expression is one
of the serious failures of our educational
system. Whether the student is to wait on
another's table or be host at his own; whether
he is to sell "goods" from one side of a counter
or buy them from the other; whether he is to
enter one of the three great professions of
law, medicine, or theology; "go on the
stage" or platform; become Minister to
France or President of the United States, it
remains precisely true that to speak effectively
will be essential to his success, and
should be as essential to his own happiness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
as it will be to that of all involved in his pursuit
of success.</p>

<p>Yet, if we give heed at all to the question
of voice and speech, it is our last, not our first,
consideration. We still look upon the mind
as a storehouse instead of a clearing-house.
We continue to concern ourselves with its
ability to take in, not its capacity to give out.
Voice and speech are still left to shift for
themselves during the period of school life
when they should be guarded and guided as a
most essential equipment for life after school
days are over. To convert the resultant
hard, high-pitched, nasal tone which betrays
the American voice into the adequate agent
of a temperament which distinguishes the
American personality, and to help English
speech in this country to become an efficient
medium of lucid intercourse, such is the object
of this book.</p>

<p>In an address upon the "Question of Our
Speech" delivered before a graduating class
at Bryn Mawr, several years ago, Mr. Henry
James said:</p>

<p>"No civilized body of men and women has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
ever left so vital an interest to run wild, to
shift, as we say, all for itself, to stumble and
flounder, through mere adventure and accident,
in the common dust of life, to pick up
a living, in fine, by the wayside and the ditch.</p>

<p>"The French, the Germans, the Italians,
the English, perhaps, in particular, and many
other people, Occidental and Oriental, I surmise,
not excluding the Turks and the
Chinese, have for the symbol of education,
of civility, a tone-standard; we alone flourish
in undisturbed and in something like sublime
unconsciousness of any such possibility."</p>

<p>So searching an arraignment by so eminent
a scholar before an audience of so high a
degree of intelligence and culture seems to
have been necessary to command an adequate
appreciation of the condition of "Our
Speech" and to incite an adequate effort
toward reform. Since the arraignment was
made and afterward published, classes have
been organized, books written, and lectures
delivered in increasing abundance, forming
a veritable speech crusade&mdash;and the books
and the classes and the lectures have availed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
much, but the real and only "reliable
remedy" lies with the teacher in the public
and private schools and colleges of the United
States. And it is to the teacher of English
and Elocution that this <i>Class Book on Vocal
Expression</i> is offered.</p>

<p><i>Learning to Talk</i> might have been a truer,
as it had been a simpler, title, yet the more
comprehensive phrase has justifiable significance,
and we have chosen it in the same
spirit which discards for the text-book in
Rhetoric or English Composition the inviting
title <i>Learning to Write</i>.</p>

<p>There is a close analogy between the evolution
of vocal and the evolution of verbal expression.
The method of instruction in the
study of the less heeded subject of the
"Spoken Word" throws an interesting light
on the teaching of the more regarded question
of the "Written Word." An experience
as teacher of expression and English in a
normal school in Minnesota has influenced
the author of these pages to so large an extent
in the formulation of her own method
of study, and so in the plan of this volume,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
that it seems advisable to record it. To the
work of reading or expression to which she
was originally called two classes in composition
were added. The former teacher of
composition had bequeathed to the work as
a text-book a rhetoric which consisted of
involved theory plus one hundred and
twenty-five separate and distinct rules for
the use of words, and the teacher of expression
found, to her amazed dismay, that the
students had been required to learn these
rules, not only "by heart," but by number,
referring to them as rule six or thirty-six
or one hundred and twenty-five, according
to the demanded application.</p>

<p>A week, possibly a fortnight, passed in
silent struggle, then the distracted teacher of
expression went to the president of the
school with these questions: "Of what avail
are one hundred and twenty-five rules for the
use of words when these children have less
than that number of words to use, and no
desire to acquire more? Could you make
teachers of these normal students by giving
a hundred and more laws for the governing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
of pupils and the imparting of the material of
knowledge, if you furnished neither pupils
nor material upon which to test the laws?"
"Certainly not!" was the restful reply of one
of the wisest of the educators I have known.
"May I lay aside the text-book and read
with these students in English for a little?"
"You may teach them to write English in
any way you can!"</p>

<p>The next day the class in composition was
discovered eagerly reading Tennyson's <i>Holy
Grail</i>, stopping to note this felicitous phrase,
that happy choice of words, the pertinent
personnel of a sentence or paragraph. The
first examination of the term consisted in a
series of single questions, written on separate
slips of paper and laid face down on the
teacher's desk. Each student took one of
these slips which read, "Tell in your own
words the story of <i>The Coming of Arthur</i>,
the <i>Holy Grail</i>, <i>Lancelot and Elaine</i> or
<i>Guinevere</i>," as the chance of the chooser
might allot a given idyl. The experiment was
a success. The president was satisfied with
the papers in English composition. Each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
student had had "something to say" and had
said it. Each student had words at his command
little dreamed of in his vocabulary
before the meeting with the Knights of the
Round Table.</p>

<p>The first step toward a mastery of Verbal
Expression had been successfully taken!
The consciousness of need&mdash;the need of a
vocabulary&mdash;had been awakened. The desire
to supply that need&mdash;to acquire a vocabulary&mdash;had
been aroused. A way to acquire
a vocabulary had been made manifest.
Out of such consciousness alone is born the
willingness to work upon which progress in
the mastery of any art depends. To the
teacher of expression it seemed no more advisable
now than it had seemed before, to
ask the students to learn either "by heart"
or by number the one hundred and twenty-five
rules of technique. But the great laws
governing the use of a vocabulary she now
found her students eager to study, to understand,
and to apply. She found her class
willing to enter upon the drudgery which a
mastery of technique in any art demands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>So in the teaching of Vocal Expression, he
who <i>begins</i> with rules for the use of this
change of pitch or that inflection, this pause
or that color of tone, before he has aroused in
the pupil the desire to express a vivid thought,
and so made him conscious of the need to
command subtle changes of pitch, swift contrasts
in tone and turns of inflection, will
find himself responsible for mechanical results
sadly divorced from true and natural
speech. But let the teacher of expression
begin, not with rules of technique, but with
the material for inspiration and interpretation;
let him rouse in the pupil the impulse
to express and then furnish the material and
means for study which shall enrich the vocabulary
of expression and he will find the
instruments of the art&mdash;voice and speech&mdash;growing
into the free and efficient agents of
personality they are intended by nature to be.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In March, 1906, the editor of <i>Harper's
Bazar</i> began a crusade in the interest of the
American voice and speech. Through the
issues of more than a year the magazine pub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>lished
arraignment, admonition, and advice
on this subject. It was the privilege of the
author of this volume to contribute the last
four articles in that series. In response to
a definite demand from the readers of the
Bazar these articles were later embodied in
a little book called <i>The Speaking Voice</i>. In a
preface to this book the author confesses her
"deliberate effort to simplify and condense
the principles fundamental to all recognized
systems of vocal instruction," making them
available for those too occupied to enter upon
the more exhaustive study set forth in more
elaborate treatises. The book was not intended
for hours of class-room work in schools
or colleges, but for the spare moments of a
business or social life, and its reception in
that world was gratifying. But, to the
author's delight, the interest aroused created
a demand in the schools and colleges for a
real text-book, a book which could be put
into the hands of students in the departments
of English and expression in public and
private institutions and colleges, and especially
in normal schools. It is in response to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
that appeal that this class-book in <i>Vocal Expression</i>
is issued; and it is to the teachers
whose impelling interest and enthusiasm in
the subject justify the publication of this
volume that the author desires first to express
her grateful appreciation.</p>

<p>To Miss Frances Nash, of the Lincoln High
School in Cleveland, for her invaluable advice
in determining the exact nature of the
need which the book must meet, and for her
assistance in choosing the material for interpretation,
my gratitude and appreciation
are especially due.</p>

<p>To others whose influence through books
or personal instruction has made this task
possible, acknowledgment made in <i>The
Speaking Voice</i> is reiterated.</p>

<h4>TO ESTABLISH A CONSCIOUS PURPOSE</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The orator must have something in his very soul
he feels to be worth saying. He must have in his
nature that kindly sympathy that connects him with his
fellow-men and which so makes him a part of the audience
that his smile is their smile, his tear is their tear,
the throb of his heart the throb of the hearts of the
whole assembly."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry Ward Beecher.</span></p></div>


<p>We have said that whatever part in the
world's life we choose or are chosen to
take, it remains precisely true that to speak
effectively is essential to fulfilling, in the
highest sense, that function. Whether the
occupation upon which we enter be distinguished
by the title of cash-girl or counsellor
at law; dish-washer or d&eacute;butante; stable-boy
or statesman; artist in the least or the
highest of art's capacities, crises will arise in
that calling which demand a command of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
effective speech. The situation may call for
a slow, quietly searching interrogation or a
swift, ringing command. The need may be
for a use of that expressive vocal form which
requires, to be efficient, the rugged or the
gracious elements of your vocabulary; the
vital or the velvet tone; the straight inflection
or the circumflex; the salient or the
slight change of pitch; the long or the short
pause. Whatever form the demand takes,
the need remains for command of the efficient
elements of tone and speech if we are to become
masters of the situation and to attain
success in our calling. How to acquire this
mastery is our problem. How to take the
first step toward acquiring that command is
the subject of this first study.</p>

<p>Is there a student reader of these pages
who has not already faced a situation requiring
for its mastery such command?
Listen to Mr. James again:</p>

<p>"All life, therefore, comes back to the
question of our speech, the medium through
which we communicate with each other; for
all life comes back to the question of our re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>lations
with each other. These relations are
possible, are registered, are verily constituted
by our speech, and are successful in proportion
as our speech is worthy of its human
and social function; is developed, delicate,
flexible, rich&mdash;an adequate accomplished
fact. The more we live by it, the more it
promotes and enhances life. Its quality, its
authenticity, its security, are hence supremely
important for the general multifold opportunity,
for the dignity and integrity, of our
existence."</p>

<p>Is there one among you whose relations
with others would not have been rendered
simpler, truer, clearer at some critical moment
had your "speech been more worthy
of its great human and social function?"
Then, do you hesitate to enter upon a study
which shall make for clarified relations and
a new "dignity and integrity of existence?"
Anticipating your reply, I invite you to take
a first step in Vocal Expression. How shall
we approach the subject? How did you
begin to master any one of the activities in
which you are more or less proficient? How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
did you learn to swim, or skate, or play the
violin? Not by standing on the shore and
gazing at the water or ice! Not by looking at
violins in shop windows! No! You began
by leaping into the water, putting on your
skates and going out on the ice; taking the
violin into your hands and drawing the bow
across the strings. But you say: "We have
taken the step which corresponds to these
in speech! We can talk!" Exactly! But
what command of the art of skating or swimming
or playing the violin would the artist in
any of these activities have achieved had he
been content to stop with the act of jumping
into the water, going out on the ice, or drawing
the bow across the violin? The question's
answer calls up an illuminating analogy.
Are not most of us in regard to our
mastery of speech in the condition of the
skater, the swimmer, the fiddler in the first
stage of those expressive acts? Are we not
floundering in the water, fallen on the ice,
or alienating the ears of our friends? "We
are so! We confess it!"&mdash;every time we
speak.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>And so to-day we shall offer no argument
against entering upon an <i>introductory</i> study&mdash;we
shall take our first step in the Art of Vocal
Expression. But we shall take it in a new
spirit&mdash;the spirit of an artist bent upon the
mastery of his art. If we flounder or fall, we
shall not be more content in our ignominy
than is the choking swimmer or the prostrate
skater. If we produce painful instead of
pleasing sounds with our instrument, we shall
not persist in a merciless process of tone production;
but we shall proceed to study diligently
the laws governing the control of the
instrument until we have mastered its
technique and made it an agent of harmonious
intercourse. We shall take the first
steps with a conscious purpose, the purpose
to make our speech worthy of its great social
and human function.</p>

<p>Then in this spirit I invite you "to plunge."
I furnish as the material for your experiment
these sentences:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>


<h4>DISCUSSION OF DIRECT APPEAL</h4>

<p>And so, gentlemen, at this hour we are not
Republicans, we are not Democrats, we are
Americans!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Curtis.</span></p></div>

<p>I shall not discuss the interpretation of
these sentences with you. I shall not interpret
them for you. Such discussion and
interpretation is your part in this study.
But you are not to discuss them with a pencil
on paper; you are to interpret them with
your voice to another mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us stop here and consider together for
a few moments this act which we call Vocal
Interpretation (which might be more simply
designated as Reading Aloud), and with
which these first studies are concerned. What
does it mean to vocally interpret a piece of
literature&mdash;a poem, a play, a bit of prose; a
paragraph, a sentence, or even a single word?
It means that you, the interpreter, must
transfer the thought contained in that word,
phrase, sentence, or paragraph from the
printed page to the mind of an auditor. It
means that you must take the thought out of
the safety vault and put it into circulation.
That is your problem, and it presents three
factors. You cannot slight any one of these
factors and expect to successfully solve your
problem. These factors are: your author's
thought, your own voice, and your auditor's
mind.</p>

<p>We shall concern ourselves in this first
study with the last of these three factors&mdash;the
mind of the auditor, or, to put it more
definitely, your attitude toward the mind of
your auditor. We shall make this our first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
concern, not because it is more essential to
successful delivery than the other two elements
of the problem, but because failure at
this point is a fundamental failure. Such
failure involves the whole structure in ruin.</p>

<p>Let me make this point explicit. Failure
of the speaker to direct the thought toward a
receiving mind&mdash;the mind of an auditor&mdash;results
in blurred thought, robs the voice of
all aim, and reduces the interpretation to a
meaningless recital of words. Consider the
first factor in the problem of interpretation&mdash;the
thought of the author. Take these first
two sentences:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Do you ask me, then, what is this Puritan
principle?</p>

<p>The Puritan principle in its essence is simply
individual freedom!</p></div>

<p>A wholly satisfying interpretation of these
lines involves a knowledge of the speech
from which they are taken, and a knowledge
of the circumstances under which it was delivered.
Complete possession of the thought,
which alone insures perfect expression, re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>quires
a grasp of the situation out of which
it was born and an appreciation of the mind
which conceived it. But with no context
and no knowledge of these conditions, and so
only an approximate appreciation of the
thought in all its fulness, the interpreter,
under the stimulus of an intent to convince
another of the truth contained in the detached
sentence, may deliver the lines convincingly!
And to carry conviction is the first and fundamental
requisite of all good delivery.</p>

<p>So it is with the second factor in your
problem. Your voice may fail at a dozen
different points, but <i>directed</i> thought can employ
so skilfully even an inefficient instrument
that the resultant expression, while never satisfying,
may still carry conviction.</p>

<p>But let the one who speaks these lines feel
no responsibility toward another, let him fail
to direct the idea toward another mind, and
the most complete possession of the author's
thought, plus the most perfect control of the
voice, will fail to make the interpretation convincing.
You must establish a relation with
your auditor! You must have an aim. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
must "have something to say," but you must
also have some one "to say it at." You cannot
hope to become an expert marksman by
"shooting into the air."</p>

<p>Then once more I bid you approach the
subject of Vocal Interpretation in a new
spirit. Let your study of the thought in these
sentences hold in its initial impulse this idea:
"I have something I <i>must tell you</i>!" Try
prefacing your interpretation with some such
phrase as this: "Listen to me!" or, "I want
to tell you something."</p>

<p>I would suggest as a preliminary exercise
that you should try "shooting at a mark"
these single words: "No!" "Yes!" "Come!"
"Go!" "Aim!" "Fire!" "Help!" "What ho!"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Listen to me!</p>

<p>"You will find the gayest castles in the air far
better for comfort and for use than the dungeons
that are daily dug and caverned out by grumbling,
discontented people."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Emerson.</span></p>

<p>Let me tell you something!</p>

<p>"Might is right, say many, and so it is. Might
is the right to bear the burdens of the weak,
to cheer the faint, to uplift the fallen, to pour
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>from one's own full store to the need of the
famishing."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Napier.</span></p>

<p>It is the angel-aim and standard in an act that
consecrates it. He who aims for perfection in
a trifle is trying to do that trifle holily. The
trier wears the halo, and, therefore, the halo
grows as quickly round the brows of peasant as
of king.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gannett.</span></p>

<p>Think twice before you speak, my son; and it
will do no harm if you keep on thinking while
you speak.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Anonymous.</span></p>

<h4>SUGGESTIVE ANALYSIS</h4>

<p class="center">HAMLET'S SPEECH TO THE PLAYERS</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Hamlet:</i> Speak the speech, I pray you, as I
pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue:
but if you mouth it, as many of your players do,
I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines.
Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand,
thus; but use all gently: for in the very torrent,
tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of your
passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance
that may give it smoothness....</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p>Be not too tame, neither, but let your own discretion
be your tutor: suit the action to the
word, the word to the action; with this special
observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty
of nature, for anything so overdone is from the
purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first
and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror
up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body
of the time his form and pressure.</p>

<p class="author">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span></p></div>

<p>Let us consider together the problem of
vocally interpreting this speech of Hamlet's,
keeping the mind of the auditor constantly
before us, the special factor in our problem
which is the concern of this study. What is
the first point to be determined? The situation,
is it not? Remember, in our previous
discussion I have made it clear that it is not
essential <i>to our present purpose</i> that we should
know, in determining our situation, the exact
conditions under which this speech was delivered.
Neither is it essential <i>to our present
purpose</i> that we should make an exhaustive
study of the play of "Hamlet" or of the
character of the Prince of Denmark. Lest
you mistake me I must reiterate the fact that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
an interpretation of these lines, looked upon
as Hamlet's speech, would require just such
exhaustive study of context and character&mdash;study
which would lead to that complete
possession which alone insures perfect expression;
but it is legitimate at this point in
our study of vocal expression to use this text
quite apart from its context as a perfect
example of direct appeal. It is legitimate to
<i>imagine</i> a situation of our own in which this
thought could be pertinently expressed. We
must then first determine what you, the
speaker, are to represent, and the nature of
the audience you are to address. One word
in the text more than any other, perhaps,
determines these points&mdash;the word "players."
With this word as a key to a probable situation,
let us imagine that you, the one who
must "speak this speech," are a stage-director
of your own play, and that we, the
class to whom you must speak, are a company
of players (actors, as we now call them)
which is about to present your play. The
fact that this is exactly the situation in
Shakespeare's play from which this speech is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
taken is interesting, but does not affect our
attitude toward the text. But that we
should assume the state of mind which
animated the author of the <i>Mouse-trap, is</i>
vital to our problem. Hamlet was intent
upon getting an effect incalculably potent
from the delivery of the "speech" he "had
pronounced." You must imagine that you
have written not merely a play, but a play
which you intend shall have a powerful influence
upon the lives of the people who are
to hear it. Once more, then, let us determine
the exact situation. You, the author of a
moving play&mdash;you, its stage-director&mdash;have
called us, your actors, together for rehearsal.
You know just how you wish the lines of your
play delivered. It is absolutely vital to the
success of your venture that we, the actors,
should grasp your ideal of delivery and act
upon it. You must convince us that this is
the only way in which you will permit the
text to be handled. You are the orator as
Mr. Beecher has drawn him for us. You will
realize, in thinking your way through this appeal,
that, while the stage-director is address<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>ing
the whole company of players, he has
singled out from the others one who is to
deliver a particular speech from his play. It
is well to follow this idea of the situation. Include
us all, then, as a class in your chosen
cast, but single out one of us, and speak
directly at the mind of that one. Look him
straight in the eye. Direct your thought in
the main to his mind, even while your thought
reaches out and draws us all into the circle of
its enthusiasm. Now, with this attitude and
intent toward an audience, try to vocally
interpret, to <i>think aloud</i> this thought. What
is the trouble? "Speak the speech" you
say, "is a difficult combination of words
to utter"? "'Trippingly' trips up your
tongue"? "You don't understand the reference
to a 'town-crier'"?</p>

<p>Ah, what discoveries we are making!</p>

<p>"You feel that you should be able to illustrate
your own ideal of delivery by delivering
these directions after the very manner
you ask your players to observe"? That
might legitimately be expected of you, I
think. "But this you cannot do!" What a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
shocking confession! Yes, but how good to
have this new knowledge of your own ability,
or, in this case, disability. How appalling to
find that you cannot easily utter the simple
combination of words, "Speak the speech, I
pray you," without stumbling; that any
word, a plain, simple English word, trips your
tongue. How appalling, but how encouraging
it is! For the discovery of this fact, the
consciousness of these limitations, "constitutes
half the battle" before us. It is a
battle. But you shall be equipped to meet
it. Turn to the chapters on "Freeing the
Tone." Find the exercises for training the
tongue. Faithful practice of these exercises
(even <i>without</i> direction, but, if you are a member
of the class in expression for which this
book was made, <i>under</i> direction) will very
shortly conquer the unruly tongue for use in
uttering any difficult combination of words.
And your teacher will patiently "pick you up"
(<i>in this first study</i>) every time you trip over
a word or phrase, and she will patiently refer
you to the corner of history which will explain
any unfamiliar portions of your text<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
if <i>you</i> will persistently try to do <i>your</i> part
at this point. That part is, to think the
thought before you directly at another's
mind. That is all we ask at this point.
Make this direct appeal for simplicity in delivery
straight to the mind of him whom you
have chosen to receive, and act upon it.
Talk to me if I am your chosen player! Convince
me! Make me realize what you expect
of me! Make me want to meet your expectation!
Make me afraid to fail you!</p>

<p>With these suggestions and this direct appeal
to you, I leave you with your teacher
and with the following material chosen for
your preliminary study in <i>Vocal Interpretation</i>.</p>


<h4>SELECTIONS FOR INTERPRETATION</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There was once a noble ship full of eager passengers,
straining at full speed from England to
America. Two-thirds of a prosperous voyage
thus far were over, and in our mess we were beginning
to talk of home.</p>

<p>Suddenly a dense fog came, shrouding the
horizon, but, as this was a common occurrence in
the latitude we were sailing, it was hardly mentioned
in our talk. A happier company never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>sailed upon an autumn sea. When a quick cry
from the lookout, a rush of officers and men, and
we were grinding on a ledge of rocks off
Cape Race. I heard the cry, "Every one on
deck!" and knew what that meant&mdash;the masts
were in danger of falling. A hundred pallid
faces were huddled together near the stern
of the ship where we were told to go and
wait.</p>

<p>Suddenly we heard a voice up in the fog in the
direction of the wheel-house ringing like a clarion
above the roar of the waves. As the orders
came distinctly and deliberately through the
captain's trumpet to "Shift the cargo," to
"Back her," to "Keep her steady," we felt,
somehow, that the commander up there in the
thick mist knew what he was about.</p>

<p>When, after weary days of anxious suspense,
the vessel leaking badly, we arrived safely in
Halifax, old Mr. Cunard, agent of the line, on
hearing from the mail officer that the steamer
had struck on the rocks and been saved by the
captain's presence of mind and courage, replied,
simply: "Just what I might have expected.
Captain Harrison is always master of the
situation."</p>

<p>No man ever became master of the situation
by accident or indolence. "He happened to
succeed" is a foolish, unmeaning phrase. No
man happens to succeed. "What do you mix
your paints with?" asked a visitor of Opie, the
painter. "With brains, sir," was the artist's
reply. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>
<p>There are men who fail of mastery in the world
from too low an estimate of human nature.
"Despise nothing, my son," was the advice a
mother gave to her boy when he went forth into
the untried world to seek his fortune, and that
boy grew up into Sir Walter Scott. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>In case of great emergency it took a certain
general in our army several days to get his
personal baggage ready. Sheridan rode into
Winchester without even a change of stockings
in his saddle-bags. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>All great leaders have been inspired with a
great belief. In nine cases out of ten, failure is
borne of unbelief.&mdash;<i>Masters of the Situation</i>,

<div class="blockquot"><p>Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers

conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal. Now we
are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
that nation, or any nation so conceived and so
dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a

is for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here
to the unfinished work which they who fought

<p>From an address delivered in the Auditorium, at
Chicago, on the afternoon of February 22, 1902,
on the occasion of the celebration of Washington's
Birthday.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The meaning of Washington in American history
is discipline. The message of Washington's
life to the American people is discipline. The
need of American character is discipline.</p>

<p>Washington did not give patriotism to the
American colonies. The people had that as
abundantly as he. He did not give them courage.
That quality was and is in the American
blood. He did not even give them resource.
There were intellects more productive than his.
But Washington gave balance and direction to
elemental forces. He was the genius of order.
He was poise personified. He was the spirit of
discipline. He was the first Great Conservative.
It was this quality in him that made all other
elements of the Revolution effective. It was
this that organized our nebulous independence
into a nation of liberty. The parts of a machine
are useless until assembled and fitted each to its
appropriate place. Washington was the master
mechanic of our nation; so it is that we are a people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>But we are not yet a perfect people. We are
still in the making. It is a glorious circumstance.
Youth is the noblest of God's gifts. The youth of
a nation is like the youth of a man. The American
people are young? Yes! Vital? Yes! Powerful?
Yes! Disciplined? Not entirely. Moderate?
Not yet, but growing in that grace. And
therefore on this, his day, I bear you the message

close analogy which exists between the evolution

and the "Literature of Feeling," and then
under the four sub-titles which all instruction
in rhetoric recognizes as the accepted divisions
of literature: Exposition, Argument,
Description, and Narrative. We do not find
the <i>exact</i> parallel for our study in direct
appeal under these subheads. Do we? No.
In order "to take the plunge" in the study
of English composition which shall correspond
to our preliminary effort in interpretation,
we must set aside for the moment the
question of <i>exposition</i>, to be entered upon as
a "first study" in verbal expression corresponding
to the question of <i>vitality in thinking</i>,
which is our first study in vocal expression,
and look for a parallel "preliminary
study" in composition.</p>

<p>In his comparative study of exposition and
argumentation Mr. Gardiner says: "An exceedingly
good explanation may leave its
reader quite unmoved: a good argument
never does. Even if it does not convert him,
it should at least make him uncomfortable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Now, when we say that argument must move
its reader, we begin to pass from the realm
of pure thought, in which exposition takes
rise, to that of feeling, for feeling is a necessary
preliminary to action. How large a
part feelings play in argument you can see if
you have ever heard the speech of a demagogue
to an excited crowd. It is simply a
crass appeal to their lower passions, aided by
all the devices of oratory, often, perhaps, also
by a moving presence. A better example is
Henry Ward Beecher's Liverpool speech, in
which he won a hearing from a hostile mob
by an appeal to their sense of fair play. Such
cases show how far argument may get from
the simple appeal to the understanding, how
little it may be confined to the element of
thought. The prime quality, therefore, of
argument is <i>persuasiveness</i>."</p>

<p>Not argument, then, but the element in
argument, called persuasion, furnishes the
study in composition which corresponds to
direct appeal in interpretation. And just
as truly as your intent to convince another
mind of the truth of your author's thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
will often take care of all other elements in
the problem of its vocal expression and result
in <i>convincing interpretation</i>, so the intent to
persuade another mind of the truth of your
own thought will often take care of all other
elements in the problem of verbal expression
and result in <i>moving composition</i>.</p>

<p>Following Mr. Gardiner a little further in
his discussion of persuasion, we find our study
in interpretation in direct accord with his
advice in the study of composition, for he
says: "This element of persuasion belongs to
that aspect of literature which has to do with
the feelings; and, as depending on the personal
equation of the writer, it is much less
easy than the intellectual element to catch
and generalize from, and almost impossible to
teach. All that I can do is to examine it in
good examples, and then make very tentatively
a few suggestions based on these examples.
For it cannot too often be written
down in such a treatise as this that the
teacher of writing can no more make a great
writer than the teacher of painting can turn
out a new Rembrandt or a Millet; in either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
case the most that the teacher can do is to
furnish honest and illuminating criticism, and
to save his pupil unnecessary and tedious
steps by showing him the methods and devices
which have been worked out by the
masters of the craft."</p>

<p>In treating the question of pure style, as
another division of the power of persuasion,
Mr. Gardiner says: "It is almost impossible
to give practical help toward acquiring this
gift of an expressive style; the ear for the
rhythm and assonance of style is like an ear for
music, though more common, perhaps. It is
good practice to read aloud the writing of
men who are famous for the quality, and,
when you read to yourself, always to have in
mind the sound of what you read. The more
you can give yourself of this exercise, the
more when you write, yourself, will you hear
the way your own style sounds."</p>

<p>With our idea for a combined study of the
two great forms of expression reinforced by
such authority, let us, in taking our next
step in this preliminary study in vocal expression,
make it also a preliminary study in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
verbal expression by using as our next selection
for interpretation, not a fragment of an
address or a part of an oration, but a complete
example of persuasive discourse. Such
an example we find in this sermon of Mr.
Gannett's "Blessed be Drudgery." And, as
we try our growing powers of lucid interpretation
upon this subject-matter, let us stop
to note its verbal construction and its obedience
to the laws of persuasive discourse.
The interpretation must be made in the class-room,
because interpretation needs an immediate
audience; the analysis of the literary
form may be made in your study: the two
processes should be carried on as far as
possible together.</p>


<p class="center">BLESSED BE DRUDGERY<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">I</p>

<p>Of every two men probably one man thinks
he is a drudge, and every second woman is
<i>sure</i> she is. Either we are not doing the thing
we would like to do in life; or, in what we do
and like, we find so much to dislike that the
rut tires even when the road runs on the whole,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>a pleasant way. I am going to speak of the
<i>Culture that comes through this very drudgery</i>.</p>

<p>"Culture through my drudgery!" some one is
now thinking: "This treadmill that has worn
me out, this grind I hate, this plod that, as
long ago as I remember it, seemed tiresome&mdash;to
this have I owed 'culture'? Keeping house
or keeping accounts, tending babies, teaching
primary school, weighing sugar and salt at a
counter, those blue overalls in the machine
shop&mdash;have these anything to do with 'culture'?
Culture takes leisure, elegance, wide margins
of time, a pocket-book; drudgery means
limitations, coarseness, crowded hours, chronic
worry, old clothes, black hands, headaches.
Culture implies college: life allows a daily paper,
a monthly magazine, the circulating library,
and two gift-books at Christmas. Our real and
our ideal are not twins&mdash;never were! I want
the books,&mdash;but the clothes-basket wants me.
The two children are good,&mdash;and so would be
two hours a day without the children. I crave
an outdoor life,&mdash;and walk down-town of mornings
to perch on a high stool till supper-time. I
love Nature,&mdash;and figures are my fate. My taste
is books,&mdash;and I farm it. My taste is art,&mdash;and
I correct exercises. My taste is science,&mdash;and I
measure tape. I am young and like stir,&mdash;the
business jogs on like a stage-coach. Or I am <i>not</i>
young, I am getting gray over my ears, and like
to sit down and be still,&mdash;but the drive of the
business keeps both tired arms stretched out full
length. I hate this overbidding and this under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>selling,
this spry, unceasing competition, and
would willingly give up a quarter of my profits
to have two hours of my daylight to myself,&mdash;at
least I would if, working just as I do, I did not
barely get the children bread and clothes. I
did not choose my calling, but was dropped into
it&mdash;by my innocent conceit, or by duty to the
family, or by a parent's foolish pride, or by our
hasty marriage; or a mere accident wedged me
into it. Would I could have my life over again!
Then, whatever I <i>should</i> be, at least I would <i>not</i>
be what I am to-day!"</p>

<p>Have I spoken truly for any one here? I
know I have. Goes not the grumble thus within
the silent breast of many a person, whose pluck
never lets it escape to words like these, save
now and then on a tired evening to husband or
to wife?</p>

<p>There is often truth and justice in the grumble.
Truth and justice both. Still, when the question
rises through the grumble, Can it be that
drudgery, not to be escaped, gives "culture"?
the true answer is&mdash;Yes, and culture of the
prime elements of life; of the very fundamentals
of all fine manhood and fine womanhood.</p>

<p>Our <i>prime</i> elements are due to our drudgery&mdash;I
mean that literally; the <i>fundamentals</i> that
underlie all fineness and without which no other
culture worth the winning is even possible.
These, for instance&mdash;and what names are more
familiar? Power of attention; power of industry;
promptitude in beginning work; method
and accuracy and despatch in doing work;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>perseverance; courage before difficulties; cheer
under straining burdens; self-control and self-denial
and temperance. These are the prime
qualities; these the fundamentals. We have
heard these names before! When we were
small mother had a way of harping on them,
and father joined in emphatically, and the
minister used to refer to them in church. And
this was what our first employer meant&mdash;only
his way of putting the matter was, "Look sharp,
my boy!"&mdash;"Be on time, John!"&mdash;"Stick to it!"
Yes, that is just what they all meant: these <i>are</i>
the very qualities which the mothers tried to
tuck into us when they tucked us into bed, the
very qualities which the ministers pack into
their platitudes, and which the nations pack
into their proverbs. And that goes to <i>show</i> that
they are the fundamentals. Reading, writing,
and arithmetic are very handy, but these fundamentals
of a man are handier to have; worth
more; worth more than Latin and Greek and
French and German and music and art-history
and painting and wax flowers and travels in
Europe added together. These last are the
decorations of a man or woman: even reading
and writing are but conveniences: those other
things are the <i>indispensables</i>. They make one's
sit-fast strength and one's active momentum,
whatsoever and wheresoever the lot in life be&mdash;be
it wealth or poverty, city or country, library
or workshop. Those qualities make the solid
substance of one's self.</p>

<p>And the question I would ask of myself and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>you is, How do we get them? How do they
become ours? High-school and college can give
much, but these are never on their programmes.
All the book processes that we go to the schools
for, and commonly call "our education," give
no more than <i>opportunity</i> to win these indispensables
of education. How, then, do we get
them? We get them somewhat as the fields and
valleys get their grace. Whence is it that the
lines of river and meadow and hill and lake and
shore conspire to-day to make the landscape
beautiful? Only by long chiselings and steady
pressures. Only by ages of glacier crush and
grind, by scour of floods, by centuries of storm
and sun. These rounded the hills, and scooped
the valley-curves, and mellowed the soil for
meadow-grace. There was little grace in the
operation, had we been there to watch. It was
"drudgery" all over the land. Mother Nature
was down on her knees doing her early scrubbing
work! That was yesterday: to-day, result
of scrubbing-work, we have the laughing landscape.</p>

<p>Now what is true of the earth is true of each
man and woman on the earth. Father and
mother and the ancestors before them have
done much to bequeath those elemental qualities
to us; but that which scrubs them into us, the
clinch which makes them actually ours, and
keeps them ours, and adds to them as the years
go by&mdash;that depends on our own plod, our plod
in the rut, our drill of habit; in one word, depends
upon our "drudgery." It is because we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>have to go, and <i>go</i>, morning after morning,
through rain, through shine, through toothache,
headache, heartache, to the appointed spot, and
do the appointed work; because, and only because,
we have to stick to that work through the
eight or ten hours, long after rest would be so
sweet; because the school-boy's lesson must be
learned at nine o'clock and learned without a
slip; because the accounts on the ledger must
square to a cent; because the goods must tally
exactly with the invoice; because good temper
must be kept with children, customers, neighbors,
not seven, but seventy times seven times;
because the besetting sin must be watched to-day,
to-morrow, and the next day; in short,
without much matter <i>what</i> our work be, whether
this or that, it is because, and only because, of
the rut, plod, grind, humdrum <i>in</i> the work, that
we at last get those self-foundations laid of which
I spoke,&mdash;attention, promptness, accuracy, firmness,
patience, self-denial, and the rest. When
I think over that list and seriously ask myself
three questions, I have to answer each with <i>No</i>:&mdash;Are
there any qualities in the list which I can
afford to spare, to go without, as mere show-qualities?
Not one. Can I get these self-foundations
laid, save by the weight, year in,
year out, of the steady pressures? No, there is
no other way. Is there a single one in the list
which I cannot get in some degree by undergoing
the steady drills and pressures? No, not one.
Then beyond all books, beyond all class-work at
the school, beyond all special opportunities of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
what I call my "education," it is this drill and
pressure of my daily task that is my great school-master.
<i>My daily task</i>, whatever it be&mdash;<i>that is
what mainly educates me</i>. All other culture is
mere luxury compared with what that gives.
That gives the indispensables. Yet fool that I
am, this pressure of my daily task is the very
thing that I so growl at as my "drudgery"!</p>

<p>We can add right here this fact, and practically
it is a very important fact to girls and
boys as ambitious as they ought to be,&mdash;-the
higher our ideals, the <i>more</i> we need those foundation
habits strong. The street-cleaner can
better afford to drink and laze than he who
would make good shoes; and to make good shoes
takes less force of character and brain than to
make cures in the sick-room, or laws in the
legislature, or children in the nursery. The man
who makes the head of a pin or the split of a
pen all day long, and the man who must put
fresh thought into his work at every stroke,&mdash;which
of the two more needs the self-control, the
method, the accuracy, the power of attention
and concentration? Do you sigh for books and
leisure and wealth? It takes more "concentration"
to use books&mdash;head tools&mdash;well than to
use hand tools. It takes more "self-control"
to use leisure well than workdays. Compare the
Sundays and Mondays of your city; which day,
all things considered, stands for the city's higher
life,&mdash;the day on which so many men are lolling,
or the day on which all toil? It takes more
knowledge, more integrity, more justice, to han<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>dle
riches well than to bear the healthy pinch
of the just-enough.</p>

<p>Do you think that the great and famous escape
drudgery? The native power and temperament,
the outfit and capital at birth, counts
for much, but it convicts us common minds of
huge mistake to hear the uniform testimony of
the more successful geniuses about their genius.
"Genius is patience," said who? Sir Isaac
Newton. "The Prime Minister's secret is patience,"
said who? Mr. Pitt, the great Prime
Minister of England. Who, think you, wrote,
"My imagination would never have served me
as it has, but for the habit of commonplace,
humble, patient, daily, toiling, drudging attention"?
It was Charles Dickens. Who said
"The secret of a Wall Street million is common
honesty"? Vanderbilt; and he added as the
recipe for a million (I know somebody would
like to learn it), "Never use what is not your
own, never buy what you cannot pay for, never
sell what you haven't got." How simple great
men's rules are! How easy it is to be a great
man! Order, diligence, patience, honesty,&mdash;just
what you and I must use in order to put our
dollar in the savings-bank, to do our school-boy
sum, to keep the farm thrifty, and the house
clean, and the babies neat. Order, diligence,
patience, honesty! There is wide difference between
men, but truly it lies less in some special
gift or opportunity granted to one and withheld
from another, than in the differing degree in
which these common elements of human power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
are owned and used. Not how much talent have
I, but how much will to use the talent that I
have, is the main question. Not how much do
I know, but how much do I do with what I
know? To do their great work the great ones
need more of the very same habits which the
little ones need to do their smaller work. Goethe,
Spencer, Agassiz, Jesus, share, not achievements,
but conditions of achievement, with you and me.
And those conditions for them, as for us, are
largely the plod, the drill, the long disciplines of
toil. If we ask such men their secret, they will
uniformly tell us so.</p>

<p>Since we lay the firm substrata of ourselves
in this way, then, and only in this way; and since
the higher we aim, the more, and not the less,
we need these firm substrata,&mdash;since this is so,
I think we ought to make up our minds and our
mouths to sing a hallelujah unto Drudgery:
<i>Blessed be Drudgery</i>,&mdash;the one thing that we cannot
spare!</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p>But there is something else to be said. Among
the people who are drudges there are some who
have given up their dreams of what, when
younger, they used to talk or think about as
their "ideals"; and have grown at last, if not
content, resigned to do the actual work before
them. Yes, here it is,&mdash;before us, and behind
us, and on all sides of us; we cannot change it;
we have accepted it. Still, we have not given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
up one dream,&mdash;the dream of <i>success</i> in this
work to which we are <i>so</i> clamped. If we cannot
win the well-beloved one, then success with the
ill-beloved,&mdash;this at least is left to hope for.
Success may make <i>it</i> well-beloved, too,&mdash;who
knows? Well, the secret of this success still lies
in the same old word, "drudgery." For
drudgery is the doing of one thing, one thing,
one thing, long after it ceases to be amusing; and
it is this "one thing I do" that gathers me together
from my chaos, that concentrates me
from possibilities to powers, and turns powers
into achievements. "One thing I do," said
Paul, and, apart from what his one thing was,
in that phrase he gave the watchword of salvation.
That whole long string of habits&mdash;attention,
method, patience, self-control, and the
others&mdash;can be rolled up and balled, as it were,
in the word "concentration." We will halt a
moment at the word:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I give you the end of a golden string:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Only wind it into a ball,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It will lead you in at Heaven's gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Built in Jerusalem's wall."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Men may be divided into two classes,&mdash;those
who have a "one thing," and those who have
no "one thing," to do; those with aim, and
those without aim, in their lives: and practically
it turns out that almost all of the success,
and, therefore, the greater part of the happiness,
go to the first class. The aim in life is what the
backbone is in the body: without it we are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
invertebrate, belong to some lower order of
being not yet man. No wonder that the great
question, therefore, with a young man is, What
am I to be? and that the future looks rather
gloomy until the life-path opens. The lot of
many a girl, especially of many a girl with a
rich father, is a tragedy of aimlessness. Social
standards, and her lack of true ideals and of real
education, have condemned her to be frittered:
from twelve years old she is a cripple to be
pitied, and by thirty she comes to know it.
With the brothers the blame is more their own.
The boys we used to play our school games with
have found their places; they are winning
homes and influence and money, their natures
are growing strong and shapely, and their days
are filling with the happy sense of accomplishment,&mdash;while
<i>we</i> do not yet know what we are.
We have no meaning on the earth. Lose us,
and the earth has lost nothing; no niche is
empty, no force has ceased to play, for we have
got no aim, and therefore we are still&mdash;nobody.
<i>Get your meaning</i> first of all! Ask the question
until it is answered past question, What am I?
What do I stand for? What name do I bear in
the register of forces? In our national cemeteries
there are rows on rows of unknown bodies
of our soldiers,&mdash;men who did a work and put a
meaning to their lives; for the mother and the
townsmen say, "He died in the war." But the
men and women whose lives are aimless reverse
their fates. Our <i>bodies</i> are known, and answer
in this world to such or such a name,&mdash;but as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
to our inner <i>selves</i>, with real and awful meaning
our walking bodies might be labeled, "An unknown
man sleeps here!"</p>

<p>Now, since it is concentration that prevents
this tragedy of failure, and since this concentration
always involves drudgery, long, hard,
abundant, we have to own again, I think, that
that is even more than what I called it first,&mdash;our
chief school-master; besides that, drudgery
is the gray Angel of Success. The main secret
of any success we may hope to rejoice in is in
that angel's keeping. Look at the leaders in the
profession, the "solid" men in business, the
master-workmen who begin as poor boys and
end by building a town in which to house their
factory hands; they are drudges of the single
aim. The man of science, and to-day more than
ever, if he would add to the world's knowledge,
or even get a reputation, must be, in some one
branch at least, a plodding specialist. The great
inventors, Palissy at his pots, Goodyear at his
rubber, Elias Howe at his sewing-machine, tell
the secret,&mdash;"One thing I do." The reformer's
secret is the same. A one-eyed, grim-jawed folk
the reformers are apt to be: one-eyed, grim-jawed,
seeing but the one thing, never letting go,
they have to be, to start a torpid nation. All
these men as doers of the single thing drudge
their way to their success. Even so must we,
would we win ours. The foot-loose man is <i>not</i>
the enviable man. A wise man will be his own
necessity and bind himself to a task, if by early
wealth or foolish parents or other lowering ci<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>rcumstances
he has lost the help of an outward
necessity.</p>

<p>Again, then, I say, Let us sing a hallelujah
and make a fresh beatitude: <i>Blessed be Drudgery!</i>
It is the one thing we cannot spare.</p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p>This is a hard gospel, is it not? But now
there is a pleasanter word to briefly say. To
lay the firm foundations in ourselves, or even
to win success in life, we <i>must</i> be drudges. But
we <i>can</i> be <i>artists</i>, also, in our daily task. And
at that word things brighten.</p>

<p>"Artists," I say,&mdash;not artisans. "The difference?"
This: the artist is he who strives to perfect
his work,&mdash;the artisan strives to get through
it. The artist would fain finish, too; but with
him it is to "finish the work God has given me
to do!" It is not how great a thing we do, but
how well we do the thing we have to, that puts
us in the noble brotherhood of artists. My Real
is not my Ideal,&mdash;is that my complaint? One
thing, at least, is in my power: if I cannot
realize my Ideal, I can at least <i>idealize my Real</i>.
How? By trying to be perfect in it. If I am
but a rain-drop in a shower, I will be, at least,
a perfect drop; if but a leaf in a whole June, I
will be, at least, a perfect leaf. This poor "one
thing I do,"&mdash;instead of repining at its lowness
or its hardness, I will make it glorious by my
supreme loyalty to its demand.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p>An artist himself shall speak. It was Michael
Angelo who said: "Nothing makes the soul so
pure, so religious, as the endeavor to create
something perfect; for God is perfection, and
whoever strives for it strives for something that
is godlike. True painting is only an image of
God's perfection,&mdash;a shadow of the pencil with
which he paints, a melody, a striving after harmony."
The great masters in music, the great
masters in all that we call artistry, would echo
Michael Angelo in this; he speaks the artist essence
out. But what holds good upon their grand
scale and with those whose names are known,
holds equally good of all pursuits and all lives.
That true painting is an image of God's perfection
must be true, if he says so; but no more
true of painting than of shoemaking, of Michael
Angelo than of John Pounds, the cobbler. I
asked a cobbler once how long it took to become
a good shoemaker; he answered, promptly,
"Six years,&mdash;and then you must travel!" That
cobbler had the artist soul. I told a friend the
story, and he asked his cobbler the same question:
How long does it take to become a good
shoemaker? "All your life, sir." That was
still better,&mdash;a Michael Angelo of shoes! Mr. Maydole,
the hammer-maker, of central New York,
was an artist: "Yes," said he to Mr. Parton,
"I have made hammers here for twenty-eight
years." "Well, then, you ought to be able to
make a pretty good hammer by this time."
"No, sir," was the answer, "I <i>never</i> made a pretty
good hammer. I make the best hammer made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
in the United States." Daniel Morell, once
president of the Cambria Railworks in Pittsburgh,
which employed seven thousand men, was
an artist, and trained artists. "What is the
secret of such a development of business as
this?" asked the visitor. "We have no secret,"
was the answer; "we always try to beat our
last batch of rails. That's all the secret we have,
and we don't care who knows it." The Paris
bookbinder was an artist, who, when the rare
volume of Corneille, discovered in a book-stall,
was brought to him, and he was asked how
long it would take him to bind it, answered,
"Oh, sir, you must give me a year, at least;
<i>this</i> needs all my care." Our Ben Franklin
showed the artist when he began his own epitaph,
"Benjamin Franklin, printer." And Professor
Agassiz, when he told the interviewer that he
had "no time to make money"; and when he
began his will, "I, Louis Agassiz, teacher."</p>

<p>In one of Murillo's pictures in the Louvre he
shows us the interior of a convent kitchen; but
doing the work there are, not mortals in old
dresses, but beautiful white-winged angels. One
serenely puts the kettle on the fire to boil, and
one is lifting up a pail of water with heavenly
grace, and one is at the kitchen dresser reaching
up for plates; and I believe there is a little
cherub running about and getting in the way,
trying to help. What the old monkish legend
that it represented is, I hardly know. But, as
the painter puts it to you on his canvas, all are
so busy, and working with such a will, and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
refining the work as they do it, that somehow
you forget that pans are pans and pots pots, and
only think of the angels, and how very natural
and beautiful kitchen-work is,&mdash;just what the
angels would do, of course.</p>

<p>It is the angel-aim and standard in an act that
consecrates it. He who aims for perfectness
in a trifle is trying to do that trifle holily. The
<i>trier</i> wears the halo, and therefore, the halo
grows as quickly round the brows of peasant as
of king. This aspiration to do perfectly,&mdash;is it
not religion practicalized? If we use the name
of God, is this not God's presence becoming
actor in us? No need, then, of being "great"
to share that aspiration and that presence.
The smallest roadside pool has its water from
heaven, and its gleam from the sun, and can hold
the stars in its bosom, as well as the great ocean.
Even so the humblest man or woman can live
splendidly! That is the royal truth that we
need to believe,&mdash;you and I who have no "mission,"
and no great sphere to move in. The
universe is not quite complete without <i>my</i> work
well done. Have you ever read George Eliot's
poem called "Stradivarius"? Stradivarius was
the famous old violin-maker, whose violins,
nearly two centuries old, are almost worth
their weight in gold to-day. Says Stradivarius
in the poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"If my hand slacked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should rob God,&mdash;since He is the fullest good,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving a blank instead of violins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He</i> could not make Antonio Stradivari's violins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without Antonio."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<p>That is just as true of us as of our greatest
brothers. What, stand with slackened hands
and fallen heart before the littleness of your
service! Too little, is it, to be perfect in it?
Would you, then, if you were Master, risk a
greater treasure in the hands of such a man?
Oh, there is no man, no woman, so small that
they cannot make their life great by high endeavor;
no sick crippled child on its bed that
cannot fill a niche of service <i>that</i> way in the
world. This is the beginning of all gospels,&mdash;that
the kingdom of heaven is at hand just
where <i>we</i> are. It is just as near us as our work
is, for the gate of heaven for each soul lies in the
endeavor to do that work perfectly.</p>

<p>But to bend this talk back to the word with
which we started: will this striving for perfection
in the little thing give "culture"? Have
you ever watched such striving in operation?
Have you never met humble men and women
who read little, who knew little, yet who had
a certain fascination as of fineness lurking about
them? Know them, and you are likely to find
them persons who have put so much thought
and honesty and conscientious trying into their
common work&mdash;it may be sweeping rooms, or
planing boards, or painting walls&mdash;have put
their ideals so long, so constantly, so lovingly
into that common work of theirs, that finally
these qualities have come to permeate not their
work only, but so much of their being that they
are fine-fibred within, even if on the outside
the rough bark clings. Without being schooled,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
they are apt to instinctively detect a sham,&mdash;one
test of culture. Without haunting the drawing-rooms,
they are likely to have manners of quaint
grace and graciousness,&mdash;another test of culture.
Without the singing-lessons, their tones are apt
to be gentle,&mdash;another test of culture. Without
knowing anything about Art, so called, they
know and love the best in <i>one</i> thing,&mdash;are artists
in their own little specialty of work. They
make good company, these men and women,&mdash;why?
Because, not having been able to realize
their Ideal, they have idealized their Real, and
thus in the depths of their nature have won true
"culture."</p>

<p>You know all beatitudes are based on something
hard to do or to be. "Blessed are the
meek": is it easy to be meek? "Blessed are the
pure in heart": is that so very easy? "Blessed
are they who mourn." "Blessed are they who
hunger and thirst&mdash;who <i>starve</i>&mdash;after righteousness."
So this new beatitude by its hardness
only falls into line with all the rest. A third
time and heartily I say it,&mdash;"Blessed be Drudgery!"
For thrice it blesses us: it gives us the
fundamental qualities of manhood and womanhood;
it gives us success in the thing we have to
do; and it makes us, if we choose, artists,&mdash;artists
within, whatever our outward work may
be. <i>Blessed be Drudgery</i>,&mdash;the secret of all
culture!</p></div>

<p>And now, as a final step in this preliminary
study, a step which shall again give practice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
in both forms of expression, you are to choose
from your vital interests one concerning
which you hold intense convictions. First
you are to set forth these convictions in the
strongest piece of persuasive prose you can
command: this is work for your study.
Second, you are to summon all your vocal
resources, and, with the one idea of persuading
us of the truth of your convictions,
make to us for them a direct appeal: this
work is for the class-room. So shall we have
combined the preliminary study in vocal
expression of <i>direct appeal</i> with the preliminary
study in verbal expression of
<i>persuasion</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="FIRST_STUDY" id="FIRST_STUDY"></a>FIRST STUDY</h2>

<h4>TO ESTABLISH VITALITY IN THINKING</h4>


<p>Among the axioms of our subject-matter
already formulated stands this one: reading
aloud is thinking aloud. If reading aloud
is thinking aloud the quality of the reading
will depend, of course, upon the quality of the
thinking. But while clear thinking does not
assure lucid reading (since there are other
elements in the problem), the converse is
true, that good reading implies clear thinking.
For it is impossible to read convincingly unless
one is thinking vitally, which brings us
to the object of this study: <i>To Establish
Vitality in Thinking.</i></p>

<p>Do you know what it means to think
vitally in reading? It means a concentration
of your mind upon the thought before you
until you, yourself, seem to be thinking that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
thought for the first time,&mdash;until you seem
to be bringing forth a thought of your own
conception instead of rethinking the conception
of another's mind. Is this a familiar
experience? It must become one if you are
to become a true interpreter. For the true
interpreter is first of all the keen thinker.</p>

<p>We do not say of the great actor, after a
performance of Hamlet, "He played Hamlet
wonderfully!" We say, rather, "He was
Hamlet." The great actor creates the part
he plays each time he plays it. He creates
the part by living the part. Even in the
same way the great interpreter creates the
thought he voices through a concentration of
mind which appropriates the thought and
makes it his own to voice.</p>

<p>We have said that the greatest need of the
human heart is for self-expression. To satisfy
the heart that act of expression must be
a creative act. True interpretation is creative
expression. The fundamental step toward
creative expression is complete possession
of the thought to be expressed. Complete
possession depends upon your power to con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>centrate
your mind upon a thought until it is
your own. The first step in interpretation
is to establish vitality in thinking.</p>

<p>The new arithmetic trains the mind to see
the relation behind the mathematical statement
of the relation. The child who "says
his tables" to-day is not repeating by rote
words and figures, he is realizing vital relations,
he is developing a sense of proportion,
he is learning to think vitally. The old
method in arithmetic left the statement
"two times one is two" a cold mathematical
fact; the new method makes it a key to living
relations. One in the "tables" of the
child in mathematics to-day stands for a
definite object, and the statement "two times
one is two" is an interesting and significant
fact. The statement through imaginative
thinking, which is vital thinking, may be
invested with personal significance and become
a personally interesting fact. Try it!
Say your "tables of one" up to ten times one
is ten, <i>thinking vitally</i>, which means getting
behind the statement of the relation to the
relation itself, behind the sign to the thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
signified. Let your "one" stand each time
for something you desire&mdash;as a small boy
might desire pieces of candy, or a miser
"pieces of eight"; now think vitally in this
way and say, "Ten times one is ten!" What
has happened to the mathematical fact? It
has become a living expression!</p>

<p>This might be called <i>interpreting</i> our
mathematics. Why not? That is the surest
way to master them! It is the surest way to
mastery of any subject, of any art, of Life
itself. It is the only real way. But we have
leaped from the part to the whole, from the
study of a detail to an application of the law
governing the whole subject. Back we must
go to our special point. If we can turn the
statement of a cold mathematical fact into
the expression of a living vital relation by
thinking vitally, so investing the fact with
personal significance and making it our own,
what can we not do with the more easily appropriated
thought which poets and philosophers
and play-writers have given us, and
with which rests our especial concern as interpreters?
Let us see what we can do! But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
first there is one other point to be considered
in this question of <i>vital thinking</i>. We have
spoken of one aspect of the process of the
mind in thinking,&mdash;the <i>concentration</i> upon
an idea until it is one's own. But there is
the passing of the mind from idea to idea to
be noted. This phase the psychologists name
"transition." This alternate concentration
and transition constitutes the "pulsing of the
mind" in reading, which Doctor Curry discusses
so vitally in his <i>Lessons in Vocal
Expression</i>. Now transition is an inevitable
result of concentration and follows it as naturally
as expiration follows inspiration. This
being true, we need only note, in our study of
the process of the mind in reading aloud, the
question of transition, letting it follow naturally
the fundamental act of concentration
which is our chief concern. If the intense
concentration is accomplished the clean
transition will follow. In choosing material
which shall require for adequate interpretation
this intense concentration of the mind,
we find our source, of course, to be the literature
of thought rather than the literature of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
feeling. The literary form which seems to
furnish the best examples for our purpose at
this point is the essay where the appeal is,
primarily, at least, an intellectual appeal.
For my own suggestive analysis and for our
preliminary study in vital thinking I have
chosen paragraphs from Emerson's essays
because Emerson's almost every paragraph
is an essay in miniature. The story is told
of the gentle seer that once in the midst of
a lecture he dropped all the pages of his
manuscript over the front of the pulpit.
The incident disturbed his auditors greatly
until they saw Mr. Emerson gather up the
leaves and without any effort at rearrangement
in the old order begin to read as though
nothing had happened. Every sentence was
almost equally pertinent to the main theme,
and suffered not from a new juxtaposition.
So in printing extracts from this source we
feel no sense of incompleteness.</p>


<h4>SUGGESTIVE ANALYSIS</h4>

<p>Let us read this passage from Emerson's
<i>Experience</i>:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To finish the moment, to find the journey's
end in every step of the road, to live the greatest
number of good hours, is wisdom. It is not the
part of men, but of fanatics&mdash;or of mathematicians,
if you will&mdash;to say that, the shortness of
life considered, it is not worth caring whether for
so short a duration we were sprawling in want or
sitting high. Since our office is with moments,
let us husband them. Five minutes of to-day
are worth as much to me as five minutes in the
next millennium. Let us be poised, and wise,
and our own, to-day. I settle myself ever the
firmer in the creed that we should not postpone
and refer and wish, but do broad justice where
we are, by whomsoever we deal with, accepting
our actual companions and circumstances, however
humble or odious, as the mystic officials to
whom the universe has delegated its whole
pleasure for us.</p></div>

<p>If you do not think your way through this
paragraph clearly, concisely, logically, intensely,
when you read it aloud your voice
will betray you. In what way? Your tone
will lack resonance, your speech will lack precision,
your pitch will be monotonous, your
touch will be uncertain, your inflections will
be indefinite. Your reading will be unconvincing,
because it will fail in lucidity and
variety. In approaching this passage let us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
study first the question of proper emphasis.
What is emphasis? The dictionaries tell us
that, in delivery, it is a special stress of the
voice on a given word. But we must use it
in a broader sense than this. To emphasize a
word is not merely to put a special stress of
the voice upon that word. Such an attack
might only make the word conspicuous and
so defeat the aim of true emphasis. True
emphasis is the art of voicing the words in a
phrase so that they shall assume a right relation
to one another and, so related, best suggest
the thought of which they are the
symbols. I do not emphasize one word in a
phrase and not the others. I simply vary
my stress upon each word, in order to gain
the proper perspective for the whole sentence.
Just so, in a picture, I make one object stand
out, and others fall into the background, by
drawing or painting them in proper relation
to one another. I may use any or all of the
"elements of vocal expression" to give that
proper relation of values to the words in a
single phrase. I may pause, change my
pitch, vary my inflection, and alter my tone-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>color,
in order to give a single word its full
value. Let us try experiments in emphasis
with some isolated sentences before analyzing
the longer passage. Here is one of Robert
Louis Stevenson's beautifully wrought
periods:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Every man has a sane spot somewhere."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Let us vary, vocally, the relative values
of the words in this sentence, and
study the effect upon the character of the
thought. Let us look upon the statement as
a theme for discussion. With a pause before
the second word, "man," a lift of the voice
on that word, a whimsical turn of the tone,
and a significant inflection, we may convert
an innocent statement of fact into an incendiary
question for debate on the comparative
sanity of the sexes. A plea for endless faith
and charity becomes a back-handed criticism
of women. Now let us read the sentence,
giving it its true meaning. "Every man has
a sane spot somewhere." Let your voice
make of the statement a plea, by dwelling a
bit on the first word and again on the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
word. Hyphenate the first two words (they
really stand for one idea). Compound also
the words "sane" and "spot." Lift them
as a single word above the rest of the sentence.
Now put "somewhere" a little higher
still above the level of the rest of the sentence.
So, only, have we the true import of this
group of words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i31">some<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i35">where.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">sane-spot<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Every-<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">man has a<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Analyze the rest of these sentences from
Stevenson in the same way, and experiment
with them vocally.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>That is never a bad wind that blows where we
want to go.</p>

<p>For truth that is suppressed by friends is the
readiest weapon of the enemy.</p>

<p>Some strand of our own misdoing is involved
in every quarrel.</p>

<p>Drama is the poetry of conduct, romance the
poetry of circumstance.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>You cannot run away from a weakness; you
must sometime fight it out or perish; and if that
be so, why not now, and where you stand?</p>

<p>An aim in life is the only fortune worth the
finding; and it is not to be found in foreign
lands, but in the heart itself.</p>

<p>The world was not made for us; it was made
for ten hundred millions of me, all different from
each other and from us; there's no royal road,
we just have to sclamber and tumble.</p></div>

<p>Now, once more, and this time with detailed
analysis, let us study the passage from
<i>Experience</i>. Let us first consider for a moment
some of the words which make this
passage powerful: <i>finish</i>, <i>journey's-end</i>, <i>good
hours</i>, <i>wisdom</i>, <i>fanatics</i>, <i>mathematicians</i>,
<i>sprawling-in-want</i>, <i>sitting-high</i>, <i>firmer</i>, <i>poised</i>,
<i>postpone</i>, <i>justice</i>, <i>humble</i>, <i>odious</i>, <i>mystic</i>, <i>pleasure</i>.
When spoken with a keen sense of its
inherent meaning, with full appreciation of
its form, and with delight in molding it,
how efficient each one of these words becomes!
When shall we, as a people, learn
reverence for the words which make up our
language&mdash;reverence that shall make us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
ashamed to mangle words, offering as our
excuse that we are "Westerners" or "Southerners"
or from New York or New England
or Indiana. The clear-cut thought calls for
the clean-cut speech. Let us say these words
over and over until they assume full value.
And now we pass from words to groups of
words. The mind and the tone must move
progressively through the first three phrases
which make up this first sentence: "To finish
the moment, to find the journey's end in
every step of the road, to live the greatest
number of good hours, is wisdom." The
phrases must be held together by an almost
imperceptible suspension and upward reach of
the voice at the end of each group of words,
and yet each phrase must be allowed to be
momentarily complete. Read the sentence,
making each phrase a conclusion, and then
again letting each phrase look forward to the
next. Each phrase is really a substantive,
looking forward to its predicate through a
second substantive which is a little more vital
than the first, and again through a third
substantive which is a little more vital than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
either of the other two. Bring this out
in reading the sentence. The next sentence
depends for its significance upon your contrasting
inflections of the three words "men,"
"fanatics," and "mathematicians"; and
again upon your sympathetic inflection of
"sprawling-in-want" and "sitting-high." "It
is not the part of men, but of fanatics&mdash;or of
mathematicians, if you will&mdash;to say that, the
shortness of life considered, it is not worth
caring whether for so short a duration we
were sprawling in want or sitting high." In
your utterance of these words can you make
"men" MEN, and "fanatics" <i>fanatics</i>, and
consign "mathematicians" to the cold corner
of human affairs designed for them? Can
you so inflect "sprawling in want" and
"sitting high" as to suggest a swamp and a
mountain-top, or a frog and an angel? Let
your voice leap from the swamp to the
mountain-top. Let it climb. Now comes
the swift, concise, admonitory sentence:
"Since our office is with moments, let us
husband them." Pause before you speak
the word "husband," and <i>husband</i> it. "Five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
minutes of to-day are worth as much to me
as five minutes in the next millennium."
Make "five minutes of to-day" one word,
and accent the last syllable, thus: five-minutes-of-<i>to-day</i>.
Let the tone retard and take
its time on the last seven words. Now poise
your tone for the next sentence. "Let us be
poised, and wise, and our own, to-day."
The paragraph closes with a more complex
statement of the theme. Let your voice
search out the meaning. Let it settle down
into the conclusion, and utter it convincingly.
Give a definite touch to the words which I
shall put in italics. "I settle myself ever
<i>firmer</i> in the <i>creed</i> that we should not <i>postpone</i>
and <i>refer</i> and <i>wish</i>, but do <i>broad-justice</i> where
we <i>are</i>, by <i>whomsoever</i> we deal with, accepting
our <i>actual</i> companions and circumstances,
however <i>humble</i> or <i>odious</i>, as the <i>mystic
officials</i> to whom the <i>universe</i> has dedicated
its <i>whole pleasure</i> for <i>us</i>."</p>

<p>Analyze vocally the following paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There is a time in every man's education
when he arrives at the conviction that envy is
ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>must take himself for better for worse as his
portion; that though the wide universe is full of
good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to
him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of
ground which is given to him to till. The power
which resides in him is new in nature, and none
but he knows what that is which he can do, nor
does he know until he has tried.... What I
must do is all that concerns me, not what the
people think. This rule, equally arduous in
actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the
whole distinction between greatness and meanness.
It is the harder because you will always
find those who think they know what is your
duty better than you know it. It is easy in the
world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy
in solitude to live after our own; but the great
man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps
with perfect sweetness the independence of
solitude.&mdash;<i>Self-Reliance.</i></p></div>


<h4>SELECTIONS FOR INTERPRETATION</h4>

<p>By choosing as further material for vocal
interpretation selections which shall also be
good examples for examination as to their
literary construction, we shall serve the
double purpose of adapting our studies in
vocal interpretation to the uses of English
composition.</p>

<p>The following selections are to be: first,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
read aloud (in class); second, examined as to
their literary construction (in class); third,
analyzed and reported upon as specimens of
exposition and argumentation (in the study).</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Exposition is an explanation, a setting forth,
or an expounding. It is an attempt to render
something plain, an effort to convey to the reader
a train of thought which represents the conclusions
of the writer upon a subject. The writer,
it is at once evident, must be acquainted with
the subject with which he deals. He is presuming
to teach, and must be in a position which
justifies him in so doing. He is prepared to
write an exposition only when he is able, in regard
to the topic in hand, to take frankly and
unreservedly the attitude of a teacher.</p>

<p>A teacher must have many good gifts and
graces; and whoever else may fail to be well
acquainted with a given lesson, he must have
mastered it thoroughly. To teach he must first
know. Whoever has taught understands how
completely different is the attitude of the teacher
from that of the pupil. While the pupil is
hardly expected to be able to do more than
reasonably well to understand the subject in
hand, the teacher must be able to explain, to
justify, to make clear relations, and to impart
the whole matter. The pupil is excused with
a sort of hearsay knowledge, but the teacher
must have a vital experience of what he teaches.
Especially must he be able to comprehend and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>to represent a subject as a whole. He is responsible
for the student's being able in turn
to co-ordinate facts and theories so as to produce
unity; and it is therefore essential that he himself
have power to hold and to make clear a
continuous train of thought.</p>

<p>The teacher, moreover, must have over his
mind discipline so firm that he is not dependent
upon moods. He must cover the wide difference
between the train of thought which springs
spontaneously in the mind and that which is
laboriously worked out as a logical sequence of
ideas relating to a subject forced upon the attention.
The pupil may, to a certain extent, indulge
the vagaries of his inclination, but the
teacher must respond to the need of the moment.
He must have trained his mind to give
an intelligent judgment upon any matter presented
to it. He is not equipped for instructing&mdash;nor
is any individual ready for life&mdash;until he
can command the resources of his inner self to
the utmost. The trained person is one who
can take a subject which may not at the outset
especially appeal to him, which is full of complications,
which is not in itself, perhaps, attractive,
and can insist with himself that his mind shall
master it thoroughly. He is able so to expend
his whole mental strength, if need be, upon any
necessary topic that the subject shall be examined,
acquired, assimilated, and then shall
be so organized, so illumined, and so presented
that others shall be instructed. The mind of
the teacher, in a word, is so disciplined that it
will work when it is ordered.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>The ideal state of mind for him who wishes to
communicate knowledge is that of being absolute
master of all its resources. Many who possess
no inconsiderable powers of thought are
practically unable to command the best powers
of their intelligence. They depend upon the
whim of the moment, upon some outward pressure
or inward impulse, to arouse their intellect.
They fail to reflect that while any ordinary intellect
naturally forms some opinion upon any
subject which interests it, only the trained mind
is able to judge clearly and lucidly of an indifferent
or uninteresting matter. In this mastery
of thought lies the difference between the sterile
and the productive mind. Only one brain in a
thousand has not the disposition to shirk work
if it is allowed, and every student has moments
when his intelligence seems almost to act like a
spoiled child that hates to get up when called on
a cold morning. To establish the power of the
will over the intellect is the object of education,
and the ability to exercise this power is what is
meant by the proper use of the word "cultivation."</p>

<p>The mental process of the cultivated thinker
when considering any subject is likely to be:
first, to become sure of his terms; then, clearly
to set before his mind the facts and conditions;
and, lastly, to make the possible and resulting
deductions and conclusions. This gives a hint,
and indeed practically affords a rule for the
writer of exposition.</p>

<p>An exposition, broadly speaking, may be
said to consist of three steps which nearly corre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>spond
to the three steps of mental activity just
set down: the Definition, the Statement, and
the Inference.</p>

<p>Definition is making clear to self or to the
reader what is under discussion.</p>

<p>Statement is the setting forth of whatever is
to be said of the facts, conditions, relations, and
so on, which it is the object of the exposition to
make clear.</p>

<p>Inference is the conclusion or conclusions
drawn.</p>

<p>These three parts will seldom be found as
formal divisions in any ordinary exposition, but
in some sort they are always present; and the
writer must at least have them clear in his mind
if he hopes to render his work well ordered,
comprehensive, and symmetrical. Together
they are woven as the strands which give a firmness
of texture to the whole.</p>

<p>To illustrate the bearing of this analysis on
the composition of an exposition, we may
imagine that a student has been required to
write a theme on "The Influence of College
Life." He has first to concern himself with
definition. He must decide what he means by
college life as a molding influence; whether its
intellectual, its social, its moral aspects, or all
these. He must consider, too, whether he is to
deal with the effect upon specific characters or
upon types; whether upon boys during the time
they are in college or as a training for after life;
whether at a special institution or as the result
of any college. If he limits himself to one phase
of influence, he must in the same way decide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
fully in what sense he intends to treat that
phase. If he is to consider the social effect of
college life, for instance, he has to define for
himself the sense in which he will use the word
"social." Is it to mean simply formal society,
adaptation to the more conventional and exclusive
forms of human intercourse, or to imply all
that renders a man more self-poised, more
flexible, and more adaptable in any relations
with his fellows? If, on the other hand, it is the
intellectual influence of college life which is to
be studied, the first step is to decide what is to
be considered for this purpose the range of the
term "intellectual"; whether it is to be taken
to mean the mere acquirement of information;
whether it has relation to acquirement or to
modification of mental conditions; whether it
means change in the mind in the way of development
or of modification; whether it shall be
applied to an alteration in the student's attitude
toward knowledge or toward life in general. All
this is in the line of definition, and it is naturally
connected with the statement of whatever facts
bear upon the topic under discussion.</p>

<p>Statement has largely to do with fact. Theory
belongs rather to whatever inference is part of an
exposition. In the statement will come the
observations of the writer; whatever he knows
of general conditions at college, or such individual
examples as bear upon the question in
hand. From these he will inevitably draw some
conclusions, and the value of the exposition will
depend upon the reasonableness and convincingness
of these inferences, as these will, in turn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
depend upon the clearness of the writer's original
knowledge in regard to his intentions and the
logic of his statements.</p>

<p>Composition, it should be remembered, is the
art of communicating to others what is in the
mind of the writer. To write without having
the subject abundantly in mind is to invite the
reader to a Barmecide feast of empty dishes.
The necessity of insisting upon such particulars
as those just given of the process of making an
exposition arises from the stubborn idea of the
untrained student that writing is something
done with paper and ink. It is, on the contrary,
something which is done with brains; it is less
putting things on paper than it is thinking things
out in the mind.</p>

<p>Before leaving the illustration of a theme on
the influence of college life we may glance a
moment more at the difficulty, even with so
simple a subject, of attaining perfect clarity of
thinking. One of the first things which must be
determined is the essential difference of life in
a college from ordinary existence. If the subject
be given out to a class of students half the
themes handed in will begin with a remark upon
the great change which comes to a boy who
finds himself for the first time freed from the
restraints of home. The moment this idea is
presented to the mind it is to be looked at,
not as something with which to fill so much
paper, but as a stepping-stone toward ideas
beyond. It is necessary, for instance, to determine
the distinctions between freedom at
college and freedom elsewhere; to decide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
wherein lie the differences in the conditions
which surround a boy in a university and one
who escapes from the restrictions of home by
going away to live in a city or in a country
village, on shipboard or in the army. To be
of value, every thought in an exposition must
have been tested by a comparison with allied
ideas as wide and as exhaustive as the thinker
is equal to making.</p>

<p>To learn to think is, after all, the prime essential
in exposition-writing, and the beginning of
thought is the realization of what is already
known. The student who patiently examines
his views on the subject of which he is to write,
who determines to discover exactly how much
he knows and what is the relative importance of
each of his opinions, is likely soon to come to
find that he is considering the theme chosen not
only deeply, but with tangible results. The
value of any exposition, to sum the matter up in
a word, rests primarily and chiefly on the
thoroughness of the thought which produces it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Arlo

<p>The <i>Idylls of the King</i> has been called a
quasi-epic. Departing from the conventional
epic form by its lack of a closely continuous narrative,
it has yet that lofty manner and underlying
unity of design which leads us to class it
with the epics, at least, in the essentials. It
consists of a series of chivalric legends, taken
chiefly from the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i> of Sir Thomas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Malory, grouped so as to exhibit the establishment,
the greatness, and the downfall of an
ideal kingdom of righteousness among men.
"The Coming of Arthur," the ideal ruler, shows
us the setting up of this kingdom. Before this
was disorder, great tracts of wilderness,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wherein the beast was ever more and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But man was less and less.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Arthur slays the beast and fells the forest,
and the old order changes to give place to new.
Then the song of Arthur's knights rises, a
majestic chorus of triumph:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Clang battle-axe and clash brand. Let the king reign.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In "Gareth and Lynette" the newly established
kingdom is seen doing its work among
men. Arthur, enthroned in his great hall, dispenses
impartial justice. The knights</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ride abroad redressing human wrongs.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The allegory shows us, in Gareth's contests
with the knights "that have no law nor King,"
the contest of the soul with the temptations that
at different periods of life successively attack it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The war of Time against the soul of man.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then follow the "Idylls," which trace the entrance
and growth of an element of sin and discord,
which, spreading, pulls down into ruin
that "fellowship of noble knights," "which are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
an image of the mighty world." The purity of
the ideal kingdom is fouled, almost at its source,
by the guilty love of Lancelot and the Queen.
Among some the contagion spreads; while
others, in an extremity of protest, start in quest
of the Holy Grail, leaving the duty at hand for
mystical visions. Man cannot bring down
heaven to earth; he cannot sanctify the mass of
men by his own rapturous anticipations; he
cannot safely neglect the preliminary stages of
progress appointed for the race; he "may not
wander from the allotted field before his work
be done."</p>

<p>So by impurity and by impatience the rift in
the kingdom widens, and in "The Last Tournament,"
in the stillness before the impending
doom, we hear the shrill voice of Dagonet railing
at the King, who thinks himself as God, that he
can make</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Honey from hornet-combs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men from beasts.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In "Guinevere," unequaled elsewhere in the
"Idylls" in pure poetry, the blow falls; at
length, in the concluding poem, Arthur passes
to the isle of Avilion, and once more</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The old order changeth, yielding place to new.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Tennyson himself tells us that in this, his
longest poem, he has meant to shadow "sense at
war with soul," the struggle in the individual
and in the race, between that body which links
us with the brute and the soul which makes us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
part of a spiritual order. But the mastery of
the higher over the lower is only obtained
through many seeming failures. Wounded and
defeated, the King exclaims:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For I, being simple, thought to work His will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have but stricken with the sword in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all whereon I lean'd, in wife and friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is traitor to my peace, and all my realm<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Reels back into the beast</i>, and is no more.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But he also half perceives the truth which it is
the poet's purpose to suggest to us. It is short-sighted
to expect the immediate sanctification
of the race; if we are disheartened, striving to
"work His will," it is because "we see not
the close." It is impossible that Arthur's work
should end in failure&mdash;departing, he declares,
"I pass, but shall not die," and when his grievous
wound is healed, he will return. The <i>Idylls of
the King</i> is thus the epic of evolution in application
to the progress of human society. In it the
teachings of "In Memoriam" assume a narrative
form.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Move upward, working out the beast,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>may be taken as a brief statement of its theme:
and we read in it the belief in the tendency upward
and an assurance of ultimate triumph:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, yet we trust that somehow good<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will be the final goal of ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To pangs of nature, sins of will,<br /></span>

<p>As an interlude study which shall look back
to the step we have just taken, and forward to
the one we are about to take, let us test our
growth in <i>vitality in thinking</i> and our need of
<i>intelligence in feeling</i>, by voicing the following
selections from didactic poetry. This
form affords the best exercise in both activities
because it makes a double appeal, and so
a double demand upon the interpreter&mdash;an
appeal through form to emotion, through aim
to intelligence, and through message and
atmosphere to both. I have chosen examples
of this form in which the beauty and fascination
of meter, rhythm, and rhyme, and the
didactic nature of the thought do not seem to
overbalance each other. If either should
predominate you must, by your interpretation,
strike the balance. In reading Robert
Browning's <i>Rabbi Ben Ezra</i> (from which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
I shall quote but a few verses) you must
carry to your auditor the full import of the
philosophy, but in doing so you must not lose
the beauty of the verse in which the poet has
set it.</p>

<h2><a name="SECOND_STUDY" id="SECOND_STUDY"></a>SECOND STUDY</h2>


<h4>TO ESTABLISH INTELLIGENCE IN FEELING</h4>

<p>Art is in bondage in this country: its
internal polity to the temperamental
ideal; its external polity to the commercial
ideal. Business and social life are in the
same bondage. In music, in drama, in letters,
in society, and in trade we permit personality
to exploit itself for commercial
purposes. The result is either chaotic or
calculated expression on every side. When
temperament seeks restraint in technique,
and policy, whether business or social, seeks
freedom in service, then shall we have that
balanced expression in art, in society, and
in trade which should proceed from the
American personality and distinguish American
life.</p>

<p>It may seem a far cry from a comment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
upon American life to the subject of this
second study&mdash;<i>intelligence in feeling</i>. Carry
the idea of balanced expression from the
introduction to the body of this exposition
and the transition is not difficult to
make.</p>

<p>"Wonderful technique, but no heart in her
singing!" "Tremendous temperament, but
no technique!" "She moves me profoundly,
but oh, what a method!" "Her instrument
is flawless, but she leaves me absolutely unmoved."
Have you ever heard such comment,
or made such comment, or been the
subject of like comment? Diagnosis of the
case, whether it be yours or another's, should
be the same&mdash;lack of poise in expression,
producing the undesirable effect upon the
auditor of no emotion at all, or of unintelligent
emotion. To determine just what
we mean by intelligent emotion is our first
problem for this study.</p>

<p>An experience I had in visiting a class in
interpretation in a well-known school of
oratory some years ago will illustrate the
point. The selection for interpretation was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the prelude to the first part of <i>The Vision of
Sir Launfal</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And what is so rare as a day in June?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, if ever, come perfect days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Heaven tries earth if it be in tune,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over it softly her warm ear lays; ..."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The work was well under way when I entered
the class-room. My entrance did not disturb
the expression on the face of the student
who was "up before" the class. A Malvolio
smile was never more deliciously indelible.
I thought at first my request to see some
work in interpretation had been mistaken
and I had been ushered into a class in facial
gymnastics. Then I concluded that Mr.
Lowell's poem was being employed as text
for an exercise in smiling. Finally the awful
truth came upon me that this teacher of
interpretation was seriously attempting to
secure from her pupils an expression which
should suggest the spirit of the June day by
asking them to assume the outward sign of
joy known as smiling. The result was a
ghastly series of facial contortions, which
left at least one auditor's day as bleak as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the bleakest December. No intelligent feeling
can be induced in interpreter or auditor
by assuming the outward sign of an inward
emotion. Some of you are recalling Mr.
James's <i>talk to students</i>, on the reflex theory
of emotion, and are being confused at this
point. Let us stop and straighten out the
confusion. Mr. James says:</p>

<p>"Action seems to follow feeling, but really
action and feeling go together; and by regulating
the action, which is under the more
direct control of the will, we can indirectly
regulate the feeling, which is not.</p>

<p>"Thus the sovereign voluntary path to
cheerfulness, if our spontaneous cheerfulness
be lost, is to sit up cheerfully, to look round
cheerfully, and to act and speak as if cheerfulness
were already there. If such conduct
does not make you soon feel cheerful, nothing
else on that occasion can. So to feel
brave, act as if we <i>were</i> brave, use all our
will to that end, and a courage-fit will
very likely replace the fit of fear."</p>

<p>The application of this principle to the
reading of these lines would seem to justify<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the method the teacher was pursuing. A
smile is acceptedly the indication of happy
emotion, the outward symbol of inward rejoicing
or joy. The June day is full of joyful
emotion,&mdash;the joy of awakening life.
Applying Mr. James's theory, a legitimate
way to induce the inward emotion would seem
to be to assume the outward sign. But wait
a moment. Let us look to our premises.
Mr. Lanier, who sings of Nature with joyful
understanding, cries in <i>Sunrise</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tell me, sweet burly-bark'd, man-bodied Tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mine arms in the dark are embracing, dost know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From what fount are these tears at thy feet which flow?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rise not from reason, but deeper inconsequent deeps.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Reason's not one that weeps.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What logic of greeting lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt dear over-beautiful trees and the rain of the eyes?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here is a great master of verbal expression
whose inward joy finds its outward symbol
not in a smile but in a tear. So you and I
may respond to Mr. Lowell's "high tide of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the year" with smiles or with tears, with
bowed head and closed eyes, or with eyes
wide and head raised to meet the returning
flood of life.</p>

<p>The effect upon me of the beauty of this
day as Mr. Lowell has painted it, my personal
emotional response is interesting psychology,
but is not my concern as an interpreter.
My own emotion and its personal
response belong to my preparatory interpretative
efforts in the study; but when the
interpretation is ready for the audience-room,
the emotion must be assimilated into the
interpretative act and appear only as part
of the illumination of the bit of life I am
presenting.</p>

<p>The object of all great art, whether creative
or interpretative, is not to exploit the
personality of the artist, but to disclose at
some point the personality of the very God
himself, which is life. The revelation not
of personal emotion but of universal life is
the legitimate aim of all artistic effort.</p>

<p>Emotional response will accompany every
vital mental conception. Abandonment to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
that response is a legitimate and necessary
part of full comprehension. But such abandonment,
as I have said, belongs to our preparation
for expression. Such abandonment
must not be taken out of the study on to the
stage. No temperamental expression along
any line is fit for the public until it is controlled
by technique, the technique which
has been worked out by the masters of every
art, not excluding the art of living.</p>

<p>It is not the effect of June upon you I
want from your interpretation, it is the spirit
of June itself. You must let me have my
own emotion. Your emotional response was
the result of your mental concept; mine,
to be intelligent, must find the same impulse.
If you impose your own emotion upon me
mine will be merely an unintelligent reflection
of yours. Taking as our ideal of the interpreter,
the absolutely pure medium, bars out
every manifestation which calls attention to
the interpreter, and so interferes with the
direct message.</p>

<p>"The natural form of expression which
literature takes when it passes beyond the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
normal powers of prose, is lyric poetry.
When your feelings rise beyond a certain
degree of stress you need the stronger beat
and vibration of verse; to express the highest
joy or the deepest grief poetry is your
natural instrument." Again corroborated in
our choice of direction in study by Mr.
Gardiner, let us turn for "material" in the
establishment of <i>intelligence in emotion</i>, to
the most intensive type of the literature of
feeling,&mdash;lyric poetry.</p>

<p>"Every now and then a man will come who
will reduce to words&mdash;as Mr. Ruskin has
done&mdash;some impression of vivid pleasure
which has never been reduced to words before.
It is only the great master who makes these
advances; by studying his works you may
perhaps come somewhere near the mark that
he has set." This further word from the
same paragraph should influence us to pause
with Mr. Ruskin's poetry in prose form for
a brief study on our way to the lyrics of
Wordsworth and Shelley and Keats, a song
from Shakespeare, and some few from the
rare, more modern lyricists. I shall trust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
you to this by-path under the guidance of
<i>The Forms of Prose Literature</i>, where you will
find passages from such masters of prose as
Mr. Ruskin and Mr. Stevenson&mdash;passages of
surpassing lyric beauty which shall furnish
models for your correlated study in Description.</p>


<h4>SUGGESTIVE ANALYSIS</h4>

<p>I have chosen for suggestive analysis of
the lyric, Shelley's ode <i>To a Skylark</i>. I
shall analyze in detail only the first five
stanzas:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Hail to thee, blithe Spirit!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Bird thou never wert,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That from heaven, or near it<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Pourest thy full heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Higher still and higher<br /></span>
<span class="i4">From the earth thou springest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like a cloud of fire<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The blue deep thou wingest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.<br /></span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">In the golden lightning<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of the sunken sun<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O'er which clouds are brightening,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thou dost float and run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The pale purple even<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Melts around thy flight;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like a star of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In the broad daylight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Keen as are the arrows<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of that silver sphere<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose intense lamp narrows<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In the white dawn clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until we hardly see, we feel that it is there.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How shall we create an atmosphere for the
reading of these verses! How can we catch
the spirit of the creator of them! Shall we
ever feel ready to voice that first line? Do
you know Jules Breton's picture <i>The
Lark</i>? Do you love it? Go, then, and
stand before it, actually or in imagination.
Let something of the spirit which informs
that lovely child, lifting her eyes, her head
in an attitude of listening rapture, steal
over you. I know her power. I have tested
it. In reading the "Skylark" with a class<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
of boys and girls from twelve to fourteen
years old, I tried the experiment. I happened
to have with me a beautiful copy of
Breton's picture. I took it to the class-room.
I wrote on the blackboard verses of the
poem and hung the picture over them. The
<i>picture</i> taught them to read the poem. The
eyes of the girl became their teacher. I tried
the experiment, with a private pupil in my
studio, with a somewhat different result. I
had told her to bring a copy of Shelley's
poems to her next lesson. "Do you know
the ode <i>To a Skylark</i>?" I asked. "Yes,"
she said. A copy of Breton's picture hung
on the wall. "Before you open your book
look at the picture," I said. She obeyed.
Her expression, always radiant, deepened its
radiance. "Do you know what the girl is
doing?" I asked. "Oh yes, she is listening
to the skylark." "How do you know?"
"I have heard the skylark sing." "I never
have," I said. "Read the poem to me."
Now when <i>I</i> read the "Skylark," I see the
girl in Jules Breton's picture, but I hear the
voice of my English pupil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>But if our apperceptive background fails
to furnish a memory of the identical sight
and sound for our inspiring, it at least
holds bird notes and bird flights of great
beauty, and we must call upon these for the
impulse to voice Shelley's apostrophe:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Hail to thee, blithe Spirit!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Bird thou never wert,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That from heaven, or near it<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Pourest thy full heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>An early autumn number of the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i> for 1907 published a poem by Mr.
Ridgley Torrence, entitled <i>The Lesser Children</i>,
or <i>A Threnody at the Hunting Season</i>.
The poem is worthy, in sentiment and
structure, to be set beside Shelley's ode. Let
us compare with the picture which the eighteenth-century
poet has given us this one
from our modern song-writer:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who has not seen in the high gulf of light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What, lower, was a bird, but now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is moored and altered quite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into an island of unshaded joy?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom the mate below upon the bough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouts once and brings him from his high employ.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet speeding he forgot not of the cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where he from glory sprang and burned aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But took a little of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little of the colored sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of the joy that would not stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wove a song that cannot die.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now let us study closely the first verse
of the older poem. Spirit and voice must
soar in the first line, "Hail to thee, blithe
Spirit!" The two words "hail" and "blithe"
are swift-winged words. Let them fly. Give
them their wings. Let them do all they are
intended to do. The rhythm of the whole
poem is aspiring. Reverence the rhythm,
but keep the thought floating clear above it
in the second line, "Bird thou never wert."
With the next two lines the tone must gather
head to be poured forth in the last line, "In
profuse strains of unpremeditated art." Let
us make another comparative study. Set on
the other side of this picture Lowell's description
of the "little bird" in his prologue
to Sir Launfal's vision:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The little bird sits at his door in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Atilt like a blossom among the leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lets his illumined being o'errun<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the deluge of summer it receives.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The second verse of the "Skylark" demands
a still higher flight of imagination and
tone. Let us try it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Higher still and higher<br /></span>
<span class="i4">From the earth thou springest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like a cloud of fire<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The blue deep thou wingest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again all the words rise and float. Sing
them over: <i>higher</i>, <i>higher</i>, <i>springest</i>, <i>fire</i>,
<i>wingest</i>, <i>singing</i>, <i>soar</i>, <i>soaring</i>, <i>singest</i>. The
reader must feel himself poised for flight in
every word of the first three verses. Why
does the poet say cloud of fire? What is the
color of the skylark? And now the tone,
which has been of a radiant hue through
these three verses, must soften a little in the
first three lines of the next verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The pale purple even<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Melts around thy flight;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>glow gold again in the last three lines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Like a star of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In the broad daylight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art unseen, and yet I hear thy shrill delight&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and become the white of an incandescent
light in the next verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Keen as are the arrows<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of that silver sphere<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose intense lamp narrows<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In the white dawn clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until we hardly see, we feel that it is there.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Do you not see that the secret of its beauty
lies, for vocal interpretation, in the color of
tone and in the inflection of the words? Say
"unseen," dwelling on the second syllable;
"shrill delight," directing <i>shrill</i> over the
head of <i>delight</i>; "keen," making it cleave
the air like an arrow; "silver sphere," suggesting
a moonlit path across water; "intense"
and "narrows," letting the tone recede
into the "white dawn"; "see," with
a vanishing stress; and "feel," with a deepening
note carried to the end. So we might
go on through the twenty-one stanzas which
make up the poem.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Please analyze undirected the next two
verses.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">All the earth and air<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With thy voice is loud,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As, when night is bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">From one lonely cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflow'd.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">What thou art we know not;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">What is most like thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From rainbow clouds there flow not<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Drops so bright to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As from thy presence showers a rain of melody.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In reading the first lines of the next four
verses we must avoid monotony.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Like a poet hidden<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In the light of thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Singing hymns unbidden,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Till the world is wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Like a high-born maiden<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In a palace tower,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Soothing her love-laden<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Soul in secret hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With music sweet as love, which overflows her bower:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Like a glowworm golden<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In a dell of dew,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Scattering unbeholden<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Its aerial hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Like a rose embower'd<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In its own green leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By warm winds deflower'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Till the scent it gives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes faint with too much sweet these heavy-winged thieves.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Vary, if only for variety, the pitch on
which you begin each of these first lines.
Let the first three words of the eighth verse,
"like a poet," ascend in pitch. Keep the
voice level in the first line of the ninth verse,
"like a high-born maiden." Let the pitch
fall in the first words of the tenth stanza,
"like a glowworm golden." And again keep
the tone level on the first line of the next
stanza, "like a rose embower'd." I leave to
you the analysis of the rest of the poem:</p>

<p>Mr. Gilbert Chesterton tells us that the
real Robert Browning of literary history arrived
with the <i>Dramatic Lyrics</i>. "In Dramatic
Lyrics," says Mr. Chesterton, "Browning
discovered the one thing that he could
really do better than any one else&mdash;the
dramatic lyric. The form is absolutely original;
he had discovered a new field of poetry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
and in the center of that field he had found
himself." The form is new, but it obeys the
fundamental law of lyric poetry, and so in
our study belongs to this chapter. The new
element which the word "dramatic" suggests
makes a new and a somewhat broader demand
upon the interpreter; therefore I have
chosen this group of <i>Dramatic Lyrics</i> from
Browning as the material for your final study
of this form:</p>

<p>That "the poet is born, not made," is
more and more an undisputed fact in every
literary age. But many a birthright of poetic
power has been saved from sale for a mess
of pottage by a wisely ordered meeting
of the young bard, while his gift was still
latent, with the masters of lyric expression.</p>

<p>Such an introduction is the object of this
study, so far as it can embrace in its aim the
ends of both forms of expression,&mdash;interpretation
and composition. There is no thought
of inducing even an aspirant to the <i>poetical
purple</i>, much less a Shelley or a Keats or an
Alice Brown, through this brief dwelling with
their immortal songs; but if this intensive
interpretative study of the highest lyric expression
does not result in a new sense of
word values, a new sensitiveness to the
music of the English language, out of which
the songs of America must be made, then
the study will have failed in its purpose
toward you. If from this suggestive analysis
of Shelley's "Skylark" you receive no impulse
to use words with a new delight in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
fitting of sound to sense, a new reverence for
their harmonious arrangement to suggest and
sustain an atmosphere; if, in short, your
vocabulary is not enriched and your choice
of words clarified through this study, then
your new acquaintance with lyric expression
will have been in vain. And, finally, if some
one of you at least is not impelled by these
excursions into the world of song to use
his enriched vocabulary in an attempt to
create a bit of lyric description in prose or
verse, then the author of this study, and the
teacher under whose direction it is made,
must admit a failure to reach with the pupil
the ultimate aim of such interpretative
effort.</p>

<p>Let us make the test. As a final problem
of this study I shall ask you to let your
emotion find expression&mdash;lyric expression&mdash;in
a bit of prose description. Don't be
afraid! Use your vocabulary! Take as a
subject: the bit of earth and sky you have
secretly worshiped; the bird song or flight
which has charmed your day; the memory
of some illumined moment; the effect of any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
one of these lyrics upon you. Don't be
afraid! And remember it is to be literature
of <i>feeling</i> rather than thought; <i>description</i>,
not exposition.</p>

<h2><a name="THIRD_STUDY" id="THIRD_STUDY"></a>THIRD STUDY</h2>

<h4>TO DEVELOP THE WHIMSICAL SENSE</h4>


<p>Addressing the <i>Gentle Reader</i> in deliciously
whimsical vein on the <i>Mission
of Humor</i>, Mr. Samuel Arthur Crothers declares:
"Were I appointed by the school
board to consider the applicants for teachers'
certificates, after they had passed the examinations
in the arts and sciences, I should
subject them to a more rigid test. I should
hand each candidate Lamb's essays on 'The
Old and New Schoolmaster' and on 'Imperfect
Sympathies.' I should make him read them
to himself, while I sat by and watched. If
his countenance never relaxed, as if he were
inwardly saying, 'That's so,' I should withhold
the certificate. I should not consider
him a fit person to have charge of innocent
youth." We can readily see from this e<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>xtract
that we need not go back to the early
part of the last century to find material for
our test of this sovereign quality, a sense
of humor. Mr. Crothers himself, the Charles
Lamb of our American Letters to-day, shall
furnish our subject-matter. Bring your
<i>Gentle Reader</i>, or <i>The Pardoner's Wallet</i>, or the
essays collected with the <i>Christmas Sermon</i>,
to class to-morrow. If these volumes are not
in your personal library, your library is sadly
lacking. Read "The Honorable Points of
Ignorance," "How to Know the Fallacies,"
or "Conscience Concerning Witchcraft." If
any one of these fails to disclose in you the
mental alertness and power of discrimination
which their author considers to be requisite
characteristics of a true sense of humor, then
<i>you</i> are sadly lacking in that coveted quality
of mind and heart, and it behooves us to
make an attempt to supply these deficiencies.</p>

<p>Can a sense of humor be cultivated, and if
it can be cultivated, is it safe to do so? some
one asks&mdash;some one who has suffered at the
hands of a clever jester perhaps. By way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
of arriving at an answer, let us examine a
little further the category of qualities which
Mr. Crothers considers requisite to true humor.</p>

<p>We have already noted mental alertness
and power of discrimination. There can be
no question as to the desirability or feasibility
of developing these characteristics,
since such development belongs to the fundamental
effort of education. But these are
but two characteristics of the quality we
are considering, and not the distinguishing
ones. "Humor," continues the category, "is
the frank enjoyment of the imperfect." Now
we scent a danger! For if, as Mr. Crothers
admits, "artistic sensibility finds satisfaction
only in the perfect," and since, as we all
admit, artistic sensibility is an end in education
devoutly to be desired, then is not a
cultivation of the "frank enjoyment of the
imperfect," oh dear and gentle humorist, a
dangerous indulgence? The conclusive answer
comes: "One may have learned to enjoy
the sublime, the beautiful, the useful,
the orderly, but he has missed something if
he has not also learned to enjoy the incon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>gruous,
the illusive, and the unexpected."
It is a conclusive reply, because we know that
it is just as essential to achievement in the
finest of the Fine Arts,&mdash;the art of living, as
in every other form of Art, to recognize
that the inrush of discord is for the final issue
of harmony; that only through our ability
to recognize illusion shall we come to know
reality; that only through sensitiveness to
the incongruous shall we develop a true
sense of the fitness of things; that only frank
enjoyment can disarm imperfection and find
satisfaction in the perfect. So let us not
hesitate to do all we can to cultivate a quality
which Thackeray defines as a mixture of
love and wit; to which Erasmus ascribes such
desirable characteristics as good temper and
insight into human nature; and for one grade
of which, in addition to all its other qualities,
Mr. Crothers claims "that it can proceed only
from a mind free from any taint of morbidness."</p>

<p>If then we conclude that it is not only safe,
but possible and desirable, to cultivate a sense
of humor, how shall we set about it? To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
answer you, as to one way at least, and that
a way of interpretation, Mr. Crothers "is
left alive," not only to furnish new material
for the exercise of the sense, but to point a
gently reminding finger toward the immortal
sources of good humor,&mdash;"Chaucer and Cervantes
and Montaigne; Shakespeare and
Bacon and Fielding and Addison; Goldsmith,
Charles Lamb, and Walter Scott, and in our
own country, Irving and Dr. Holmes and
James Russell Lowell." Whatever period
of time your schedule grants to this phase
of the work should be dedicated to a closer
acquaintance with the flavor and atmosphere
of these great-hearted humorists in their most
genial moments. Let us also heed Mr.
Crothers' warning against the humor of the
Dean Swifts which "would be so irresistible
were it not bad humor." Let us avoid more
intimate acquaintance with the broad variety
furnished by the Mark Twains and Mr.
Dooleys, which may be legitimately classed
as "good humor," but which is so obvious
as to be little conducive to that mental alertness
and power of discrimination which we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
aim to acquire through this study. Instead,
let us seek the gracious company of William
Dean Howells in the whimsical mood he so
often induces.</p>

<p>Accepting, then, as a distinguishing characteristic
of the humor we desire to cultivate,
ability to enjoy the incongruous, the illusive,
and the unexpected, let us look to a master
maker of these conditions for class-room
guidance in this effort. I suppose Mr. Lewis
Carroll has done more to develop this distinguishing
characteristic than any other
contributor to our Letters. So we shall go
on an excursion with his <i>Alice</i> into the
<i>Wonderland</i> he made for her. If her frank
enjoyment and free acceptance of the incongruous
and the unexpected does not prove
infectious, we must be forever written down
among those who could not understand
<i>Peter Pan</i>. We shall read and enjoy a chapter
or two of <i>Alice</i> together in class, but for
suggestive analysis along interpretative lines
Heaven forbid that I should lay violent hands
on her text. No one can teach you to interpret
your <i>Alice</i> save Alice herself. You may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
walk with her, talk with her, dwindle and
grow with her, join her adventures in any
way she will permit, but you may not analyze
nor dissect her. You may learn to interpret
her only by living with her and loving her.</p>

<p>Now <i>&AElig;sop</i> is another matter. However
long you may live with him, however much
you may love his fables, there is a trick of
interpretation to be learned in voicing his
philosophy which will develop the whimsical
side of your sense of humor and counteract
the insistent moral tone attached to every
fable.</p>


<h4>SUGGESTIVE ANALYSIS</h4>

<p>The danger in handling a fable does not
lie, as the interpreter seems so often to think,
in adopting too serious a tone. All the literature
of pure fancy, from the humorous
essays of Bacon through the <i>Arabian Nights</i>
to the nonsensical rhymes of Lear, must be
treated with great gravity of tone and temper
by the interpreter. It is not levity, but
only whimsicality of temperament, I demand
from one who would read from this particu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>lar
lore to me. I want my whimsical friend
to interpret my Chaucer and Crothers, <i>Peter
Pan</i> and the <i>Pied Piper</i>, Hans Christian Andersen,
Carroll, and Lear, and all the rest
of the genial host who minister to my most
precious sense of nonsense. And, perhaps,
most of all, it is he (the whimsical friend)
who must read fables to me, for a fable,
the dictionary tells us, is "a story in which,
by the imagined dealings of men with animals
or mere things, or by the supposed
doings of these alone, useful lessons are
taught." Now a moral "rubbed in" is like
an overdose of certain kinds of medicine,
where a little cures, too much kills. It is
the presence of the <i>lesson</i> which the whimsical
tone alone can offset. The whimsical
tone never falls into the monotone. Whimsicality
always seeks variety of emphasis and
movement. Let us apply this to the reading
of the fable called</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>THE CROW AND THE PITCHER</p>

<p>A crow, half dead with thirst, came upon a
pitcher which had once been full of water; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>when the crow put his beak into the mouth of
the pitcher he found that only very little water
was left in it, and that he could not reach far
enough down to get at it. He tried, and he
tried, but at last had to give up in despair.
Then a thought came to him, and he took a
pebble and dropped it into the pitcher. Then
he took another pebble and dropped it into the
pitcher. Then he took another pebble and
dropped that into the pitcher. Then he took
another pebble and dropped that into the
pitcher. Then he took another pebble and
dropped that into the pitcher. Then he took
another pebble and dropped that into the
pitcher. At last, at last, he saw the water
mount up near him; and after casting in a few
more pebbles he was able to quench his thirst
and save his life.</p>

<p>Little by little does the trick.</p></div>

<p>How shall we avoid the monotony of the
lines beginning "Then he took another pebble
and dropped it into the pitcher"? Note
that this line is followed by one in which
but two words are changed, and then by a
line with but one change, and then by three
lines with no change at all. Our only hope
lies in a variation of emphasis and movement&mdash;a
whimsical variation. Try it! Give "another"
the particular stress in reading the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
first of these lines. Pause at the close of the
line as if to study the effect of the pebble.
In the next line "that," of course, takes the
emphasis. Pause before the word and give
it a salient stress. The movement of the
voice through these two lines has been deliberate.
On the next line hasten it a little,
and make the pause at the close of the line
shorter. With the fourth line let the tone
settle down to work. Give each of the first
five words equal stress. With the fifth and
last line let us feel that you may "go on
forever," and surprise us with a very short
pause and a joyful stress upon "at last, at
last," and don't fail to let the enthusiasm of
your tone give us the full sense of the relief
which comes with the mounting of the water,
and the delight in the conclusion&mdash;"he was
able to quench his thirst and save his life."
And now, most whimsically, let us voice the
moral, "Little by little does the trick."</p>


<h4>SELECTIONS FOR INTERPRETATION</h4>


<div class="blockquot"><p>THE LION AND THE MOUSE</p>

<p>Once when a lion was asleep a little mouse
began running up and down upon him; this soon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>wakened the lion, who placed his huge paw
upon him, and opened his big jaws to swallow
him. "Pardon, O King," cried the little mouse;
"forgive me this time. I shall never forget it;
who knows but what I may be able to do you a
turn some of these days?" The lion was so
tickled at the idea of the mouse being able to
help him, that he lifted up his paw and let him
go. Some time after the lion was caught in a
trap, and the hunters, who desired to carry him
alive to the king, tied him to a tree while they
went in search of a wagon to carry him on.
Just then the little mouse happened to pass by,
and seeing the sad plight in which the lion was,
went up to him and soon gnawed away the
ropes that bound the king of the beasts. "Was
I not right?" said the little mouse.</p>

<p>Little friends may prove great friends.</p>


<p>THE WIND AND THE SUN</p>

<p>The wind and the sun were disputing which
was the stronger. Suddenly they saw a traveler
coming down the road, and the sun said: "I
see a way to decide our dispute. Whichever of
us can cause that traveler to take off his cloak
shall be regarded as the stronger. You begin."
So the sun retired behind a cloud, and the wind
began to blow as hard as he could upon the
traveler. But the harder he blew the more
closely did the traveler wrap his cloak round
him, till at last the wind had to give up in
despair. Then the sun came out and shone in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>all his glory upon the traveler, who soon found
it too hot to walk with his cloak on.</p>

<p>And, now, here is Alice herself to play
with a little. Go fearlessly into her <i>Wonderland</i>
and let her teach you "how to meet
the illusive, the incongruous, and the unexpected."
Let her minister to your ability to
enjoy the imperfect. Let her develop your
<i>sense of humor</i>. If she cannot do so no one
can.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having
nothing to do; once or twice she had peeped
into the book her sister was reading, but it had
no pictures or conversations in it, "and what is
the use of a book," thought Alice, "without
pictures or conversations?"</p>

<p>So she was considering in her own mind (as
well as she could, for the hot day made her feel
very sleepy and stupid) whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the
trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes
ran close by her.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>
<p>There was nothing so <i>very</i> remarkable in that;
nor did Alice think it so <i>very</i> much out of the
way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear!
Oh dear! I shall be too late!" (when she
thought it over afterward, it occurred to her
that she ought to have wondered at this, but
at the time it all seemed quite natural); but
when the Rabbit actually <i>took a watch out of
its waistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it, and then
hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed
across her mind that she had never before seen
a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
watch to take out of it, and, burning with
curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and
fortunately was just in time to see it pop down
a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>

<p>In another moment down went Alice after it,
never once considering how in the world she
was to get out again.</p>

<p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel
for some way, and then dipped suddenly down&mdash;so
suddenly that Alice had not a moment to
think about stopping herself before she found
herself falling down a very steep well.</p>

<p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very
slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went
down to look about her, and to wonder what
was going to happen next. First, she tried to
look down and make out what she was coming
to, but it was too dark to see anything; then
she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed
that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves;
here and there she saw maps and pi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>ctures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar
from one of the shelves as she passed; it was
labeled "ORANGE MARMALADE," but to her
great disappointment it was empty. She did
not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody,
so managed to put it into one of the cupboards
as she fell past it.</p>

<p>"Well!" thought Alice to herself. "After
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of
tumbling down-stairs! How brave they'll all
think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything
about it, even if I fell off the top of the
house!" (Which was very likely true.)</p>

<p>Down, down, down. Would the fall <i>never</i>
come to an end? "I wonder how many miles
I've fallen by this time?" she said, aloud. "I
must be getting somewhere near the center of
the earth. Let me see: that would be four
thousand miles down, I think&mdash;" (for, you see,
Alice had learned several things of this sort in
her lessons in the school-room, and though this
was not a <i>very</i> good opportunity for showing off
her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to
her, still it was good practice to say it over) "&mdash;yes,
that's about the right distance&mdash;but
then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've
got to?" (Alice had no idea what Latitude
was, or Longitude either, but thought they were
nice, grand words to say.)</p>

<p>Presently she began again. "I wonder if I
shall fall right <i>through</i> the earth? How funny
it'll seem to come out among the people that
walk with their heads downward! The Antipa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>thies,
I think&mdash;" (she was rather glad there <i>was</i>
no one listening this time, as it didn't sound at
all the right word) "&mdash;but I shall have to ask
them what the name of the country is, you
know. 'Please, ma'am, is this New Zealand
or Australia?'" (and she tried to courtesy as
she spoke&mdash;fancy <i>courtesying</i> as you're falling
through the air! Do you think you could manage
it?) "And what an ignorant little girl
she'll think me! No, it'll never do to ask;
perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere."</p>

<p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to
do, so Alice soon began talking again. "Dinah'll
miss me very much to-night, I should think!"
(Dinah was the cat.) "I hope they'll remember
her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my
dear, I wish you were down here with me!
There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you
might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse,
you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?"
And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and
went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of
way, "Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?"
and sometimes, "Do bats eat cats?" for, you
see, as she couldn't answer either question, it
didn't much matter which way she put it. She
felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun
to dream that she was walking hand in hand
with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,
"Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever
eat a bat?" when suddenly, thump! thump!
down she came upon a heap of dry leaves, and
the fall was over.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up
on her feet in a moment. She looked up, but
it was all dark overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the White Rabbit was
still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not
a moment to be lost; away went Alice like the
wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it
turned a corner, "Oh my ears and whiskers, how
late it's getting!" She was close behind it
when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was
no longer to be seen; she found herself in a
long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of
lamps hanging from the roof.</p>

<p>There were doors all round the hall, but they
were all locked; and when Alice had been all
the way down one side and up the other, trying
every door, she walked sadly down the middle,
wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p>

<p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged
table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing
on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first
thought was that it might belong to one of the
doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks
were too large or the key was too small, but at
any rate it would not open any of them. However,
the second time round she came upon a
low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches
high. She tried the little golden key in the
lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p>

<p>Alice opened the door and found that it led
into a small passage, not much larger than a
rat-hole. She knelt down and looked along the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
How she longed to get out of that dark hall,
and wander about among those beds of bright
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could
not even get her head through the doorway!
"And even if my head would go through,"
thought poor Alice, "it would be of very little
use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I
could shut up like a telescope! I think I could,
if I only knew how to begin." For, you see, so
many out-of-the-way things had happened lately
that Alice had begun to think that very few
things indeed were really impossible.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the
little door, so she went back to the table, half
hoping she might find another key on it, or, at
any rate, a book of rules for shutting people up
like telescopes. This time she found a little
bottle on it ("which certainly was not here before,"
said Alice), and round its neck a paper
label, with the words "DRINK ME" beautifully
printed on it in large letters.</p>

<p>It was all very well to say "Drink me," but
the wise little Alice was not going to do <i>that</i>
in a hurry. "No, I'll look first," she said, "and
see whether it's marked '<i>poison</i>' or not"; for
she had read several nice little histories about
children who had got burned, and eaten up by
wild beasts, and many other unpleasant things,
all because they <i>would</i> not remember the simple
rules their friends had taught them: such as,
that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold
it too long; and that, if you cut your finger
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span><i>very</i> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and
she had never forgotten that, if you drink
much from a bottle marked "<i>poison</i>," it is almost
certain to disagree with you, sooner or
later.</p>

<p>However, this bottle was <i>not</i> marked "poison,"
so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding
it very nice (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast
turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast), she very
soon finished it off.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"What a curious feeling!" said Alice. "I
must be shutting up like a telescope."</p>

<p>And so it was, indeed: she was now only ten
inches high, and her face brightened up at the
thought that she was now the right size for
going through the little door into that lovely
garden. First, however, she waited for a few
minutes to see if she was going to shrink any
further: she felt a little nervous about this,
"for it might end, you know," said Alice, "in
my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder
what I should be like then?" And she tried
to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after
it is blown out, for she could not remember ever
having seen such a thing.</p>

<p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened,
she decided to go into the garden at
once, but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to
the door she found she had forgotten the little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>golden key, and when she went back to the
table for it she found she could not possibly reach
it. She could see it quite plainly through the
glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of
the table-legs, but it was too slippery; and
when she had tired herself out with trying, the
poor little thing sat down and cried.</p>

<p>"Come, there's no use in crying like that!"
said Alice to herself, rather sharply. "I advise
you to leave off this minute!" She generally
gave herself very good advice (though she very
seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded
herself so severely as to bring tears in her eyes;
and once she remembered trying to box her own
ears for having cheated herself in a game of
croquet she was playing against herself, for this
curious child was very fond of pretending to be
two people. "But it's no use now," thought
poor Alice, "to pretend to be two people! Why,
there's hardly enough of me left to make <i>one</i>
respectable person!"</p>

<p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that
was lying under the table. She opened it, and
found in it a very small cake, on which the
words "EAT ME" were beautifully marked in
currants. "Well, I'll eat it," said Alice, "and
if it makes me larger I can reach the key, and
if it makes me smaller I can creep under the
door; so, either way, I'll get into the garden,
and I don't care which happens!"</p>

<p>She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself,
"Which way? Which way?" holding her
hand on the top of her head to feel which way
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>it was growing, and she was quite surprised to
find that she remained the same size. To be
sure, this generally happens when one eats
cake, but Alice had got so much into the way
of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things
to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid
for life to go on in the common way.</p>

<p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off
the cake.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<p>THE POOL OF TEARS</p>

<p>"Curiouser and curiouser!" cried Alice (she
was so much surprised that for the moment she
quite forgot how to speak good English); "now
I'm opening out like the largest telescope that
ever was! Good-by, feet!" (for when she
looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost
out of sight, they were getting so far off).
"Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put
on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?
I'm sure <i>I</i> sha'n't be able! I shall be a great
deal too far off to trouble myself about you:
you must manage the best way you can&mdash;but
I must be kind to them," thought Alice, "or
perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go!
Let me see; I'll give them a new pair of boots
every Christmas."</p>

<p>And she went on planning to herself how she
would manage it. "They must go by the car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>rier,"
she thought; "and how funny it'll seem,
sending presents to one's own feet! And how
odd the directions will look!&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Alice's Right Foot, Esq.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i26">(<i>with Alice's love</i>).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!"</p>

<p>Just then her head struck against the roof of
the hall&mdash;in fact she was now more than nine
feet high&mdash;and she at once took up the little
golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p>

<p>Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do,
lying down on one side, to look through into
the garden with one eye, but to get through
was more hopeless than ever. She sat down
and began to cry again.</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said
Alice&mdash;"a great girl like you" (she might well
say this), "to go on crying in this way! Stop
this moment, I tell you!" But she went on all
the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there
was a large pool all round her, about four inches
deep and reaching half down the hall.</p>

<p>After a time she heard a little pattering of
feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her
eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a
pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large
fan in the other. He came trotting along in a
great hurry, muttering to himself as he came,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>"Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she
be savage if I've kept her waiting!" Alice felt
so desperate that she was ready to ask help of
any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her,
she began, in a low, timid voice, "If you please,
sir&mdash;" The Rabbit started violently, dropped
the white kid gloves and the fan, and scurried
away into the darkness as hard as he could go.</p>

<p>Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the
hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all
the time she went on talking: "Dear, dear!
How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday
things went on just as usual. I wonder if
I've been changed in the night? Let me think:
was I the same when I got up this morning? I
almost think I can remember feeling a little
different. But if I'm not the same, the next
question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, <i>that's</i>
the great puzzle!" And she began thinking
over all the children she knew that were of the
same age as herself, to see if she could have
been changed for any of them.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I'm not Ada," she said, "for her
hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't
go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be
Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,
oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, <i>she's</i>
she and <i>I'm</i> I, and&mdash;oh dear, how puzzling it all
is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to
know. Let me see: four times five is twelve,
and four times six is thirteen, and four times
seven is&mdash;oh dear! I shall never get to twenty
at that rate! However, the Multiplication

London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the
capital of Rome, and Rome&mdash;no, <i>that's</i> all
wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed
for Mabel! I'll try and say '<i>How doth the
little&mdash;</i>'" and she crossed her hands on her lap
as if she were saying lessons, and began to
repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and
strange, and the words did not come the same
as they used to do:</p>

<p>"I'm sure those are not the right words,"
said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears
again as she went on: "I must be Mabel, after
all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky
little house, and have next to no toys to play
with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn!
No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm
Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use
their putting their heads down and saying,
'Come up again, dear!' I shall only look up
and say, 'Who am I, then? Tell me that first,
and then, if I like being that person, I'll come
up; if not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody
else.' But, oh dear!" cried Alice, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>sudden burst of tears, "I do wish they <i>would</i>
put their heads down! I am so <i>very</i> tired of
being all alone here!"</p>

<p>As she said this she looked down at her hands,
and was surprised to see that she had put on
one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while
she was talking. "How <i>can</i> I have done that?"
she thought. "I must be growing small again."
She got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she
could guess, she was now about two feet high,
and was going on shrinking rapidly. She soon
found out that the cause of this was the fan
she was holding, and she dropped it hastily,
just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p>

<p>"That <i>was</i> a narrow escape!" said Alice, a
good deal frightened at the sudden change, but
very glad to find herself still in existence; "and
now for the garden!" and she ran with all speed
back to the little door; but, alas! the little
door was shut again, and the little golden key
was lying on the glass table as before, "and
things are worse than ever," thought the poor
child, "for I never was so small as this before&mdash;never!
And I declare it's too bad, that it is!"</p>

<p>As she said these words her foot slipped, and
in another moment, splash! she was up to her
chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she
had somehow fallen into the sea, "and in that
case I can go back by railway," she said to
herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once
in her life, and had come to the general conclusion
that wherever you go to on the English
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>coast you find a number of bathing-machines in
the sea, some children digging in the sand with
wooden spades, then a row of lodging-houses,
and behind them a railway station.) However,
she soon made out that she was in the pool of
tears which she had wept when she was nine
feet high.</p>

<p>"I wish I hadn't cried so much!" said Alice,
as she swam about, trying to find her way out.
"I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears! That <i>will</i> be
a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything
is queer to-day."</p>

<p>Just then she heard something splashing about
in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer
to make out what it was. At first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then
she remembered how small she was now, and
she soon made out that it was only a mouse that
had slipped in like herself.</p>

<p>"Would it be of any use, now," thought Alice,
"to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way
down here that I should think very
likely it can talk; at any rate, there's no harm
in trying." So she began: "O Mouse, do you
know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse!" (Alice
thought this must be the right way of speaking
to a mouse. She had never done such a thing
before, but she remembered having seen in her
brother's Latin Grammar, "A mouse&mdash;of a
mouse&mdash;to a mouse&mdash;a mouse&mdash;O mouse!")
The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>and seemed to her to wink with one of its little
eyes, but it said nothing.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,"
thought Alice; "I dare say it's a French mouse,
come over with William the Conqueror." (For
with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no
very clear notion how long ago anything had
happened.) So she began again: "Ou est ma
chatte?" which was the first sentence in her
French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden
leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all
over with fright. "Oh, I beg your pardon!"
cried Alice, hastily, afraid that she had hurt
the poor animal's feelings. "I quite forgot
you didn't like cats."</p>

<p>"Not like cats!" cried the Mouse, in a shrill,
passionate voice. "Would <i>you</i> like cats if you
were me?"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps not," said Alice, in a soothing
tone. "Don't be angry about it. And yet
I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think
you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only
see her. She is such a dear, quiet thing,"
Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily
about in the pool, "and she sits purring so nicely
by the fire, licking her paws and washing her
face&mdash;and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse&mdash;and
she's such a capital one for catching
mice&mdash;oh, I beg your pardon!" cried Alice
again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
over, and she felt certain it must be really
offended. "We won't talk about her any more,
if you'd rather not."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>
<p>"We, indeed!" cried the Mouse, who was
trembling down to the end of his tail. "As if
<i>I</i> would talk on such a subject! Our family
always <i>hated</i> cats&mdash;nasty, low, vulgar things!
Don't let me hear the name again!"</p>

<p>"I won't, indeed!" said Alice, in a great
hurry to change the subject of conversation.
"Are you&mdash;are you fond&mdash;of&mdash;of dogs?" The
Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:
"There is such a nice little dog near our house
I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed
terrier, you know, with oh, such long, curly
brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you
throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its
dinner, and all sorts of things&mdash;I can't remember
half of them&mdash;and it belongs to a farmer,
you know, and he says it's so useful it's worth
a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats
and&mdash;oh dear!" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
"I'm afraid I've offended it again!" For the
Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as
it could go, and making quite a commotion in
the pool as it went.</p>

<p>So she called softly after it, "Mouse dear!
Do come back again, and we won't talk about
cats, or dogs either, if you don't like them!"
When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and
swam slowly back to her. Its face was quite
pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said
in a low, trembling voice, "Let us get to the
shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and
you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs."</p>

<p>It was high time to go, for the pool was get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>ting
quite crowded with the birds and animals
that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and
a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several
other curious creatures. Alice led the way,
and the whole party swam to the shore.</p>

<p>We must not deny to humor and fancy
the opportunity for creative effort offered to
other faculties in our previous studies. What
form shall the effort take: fable, fairy tale,
a whimsical play of fancy in essay, or merely
a nonsense rhyme? I think we must bar
the <i>limerick</i> from our serious creative efforts
in the study. You may engage as a class
in an extemporaneous contest in the making
of this infectious form of verse if you like.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there is still another class-room
test of humor which should be made,&mdash;the
test of the clever anecdote. There is
nothing which so effectually discloses the
quality of your sense of humor as your attitude
toward so-called funny stories. Judgment
in such a case will rest upon three
points: What you think is "funny" enough
to tell; when you judge it "apropos" to tell;
and the manner of the telling. Three warnings
are in order at this point. If you find
that you must preface your anecdote with
the question too often heard, "Do you think
you can stand this story?&mdash;it really <i>is</i>
clever," in the name of clean humor, don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
tell it! If you find you must introduce your
anecdote with the remark, "Apropos of
nothing," or "This is not apropos, but"&mdash;in
the name of "sulphitic" humor, don't tell
it; finally, if you don't know <i>how</i> to tell it,
in the name of any and all humor, <i>don't tell
it</i>.</p>

<p>With these cautions in mind, I shall ask
you to bring to class to-morrow your best
three "funny stories." Conflicting choice is
not likely to have appropriated all three of
your favorite anecdotes. Should you find
that it has done so, never mind. Your taste,
though it coincides with another's, can be
quite as well questioned or commended; and
the manner of your telling will be subjected
to trial by comparison, which, if not always
comfortable, is always helpful (<i>when met in
the right spirit</i>).</p>

<p>Remember, the serious creative work you
are to produce is to take the form of a fable,
fairy story, or humorous essay.</p>

<h2><a name="FOURTH_STUDY" id="FOURTH_STUDY"></a>FOURTH STUDY</h2>

<h4>TO DEVELOP IMAGINATIVE VIGOR</h4>


<p>In one of the great manufacturing towns
of the Northwest there are some twenty-five
thousand girls employed in factories.
The city permits conditions of work hostile
to the physical life of these girls. Civic reform
is trying to control these conditions.
In time it doubtless will succeed in doing so;
meanwhile it makes efforts in other directions.
It establishes working girls' clubs.
A class in literature in one of these clubs enlisted
the services of a comprehending young
teacher, who kept the girls interested for more
than two years. A little girl from a bag factory
entered this class. She came to every
meeting of the first year. She did not join
in the discussions nor ask questions nor evince
unusual intelligence or enjoyment, but she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
<i>came</i> every night. The class began its second
year. The little girl from the bag factory
was the first to enroll. The teacher could
not cover the surprise in her question, "Are
you coming into the class again?" The girl's
breathless "Oh yes" sent her to investigate
the case. She went to the factory. She
found the child standing at a bench folding
bags. Eight hours a day she folded bags.
A swing back on her right foot with the stuff
of which the bag was made grasped in her
hands&mdash;a swing forward, and her hands
brought the edges of the stuff together evenly.
Over and over a thousand times the single
motion repeated made up the girl's day.
"It used to make me tired," she said, simply.
"But it doesn't any more?" "No, because
now I forget what I am doing sometimes.
I have my book, you see. They let me fasten
it here." There it was&mdash;a paper copy of
Shelley's poems. The print was good; the
teacher had seen to that. She had observed
that factory girls' eyes are not always very
strong. The book was fastened to the front
of the desk. The child could catch a line<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
from time to time without interrupting her
bag-folding. "But I know most of the
poems we have studied in class by heart."
So she had to recall but a line, and then off
she would go through the windows of the
stifling factory into the open fields on the
wings of her <i>imagination</i>. She was a swift,
sure, little workman; her eye watched the
stuff before her and measured it truly; her
hands obeyed her eye, did her work efficiently,
and "kept her job." But the eye of her
imagination had been opened in the literature
class and kept her soul alive in spite
"of her job." This is a true story. It has
significance for you and me.</p>

<p>If through the use of her imagination a
little factory girl can escape from the monotony
of bag-folding, and find freedom and
joy in the lyric world Shelley has created,
what limit need be set to our emancipation
through the development of this faculty?</p>

<p>But emancipation is but one result of such
development. Listen to David as he stands
with his harp before the King in Browning's
story of <i>Saul</i>. Already his song has released<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the monarch from the depths of his great
despair, but now comes the boy's cry:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">What spell or what charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For, awhile there was trouble within me) what next should I urge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sustain him where song had restored him?...<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then fancies grew rife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which had come long ago on the pasture, when round me the sheep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fed in silence&mdash;above, the one eagle wheeled slow as in sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I lay in my hollow and mused on the world that might lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Neath his ken, though I saw but the strip 'twixt the hill and the sky:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I laughed&mdash;"Since my days are ordained to be passed with my flocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me people at least, with my fancies, the plains and the rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dream the life I am never to mix with, and image the show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mankind as they live in those fashions I hardly shall know!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Schemes of life, its best rules and right uses, the courage that gains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the prudence that keeps what men strive for."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And now those old trains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of vague thought came again; I grew surer; so, once more the string<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my harp made response to my spirit....<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></div></div>

<p>So the imagination of the young shepherd
boy had not only disregarded the limits of
his actual environment and escaped in fancy
to the great world beyond, but so vividly had
he realized that world <i>through his imagination</i>
that his sympathies had been made broad
to comprehend a monarch's need and his
song potent to meet it. Experience alone
gives comprehension. We are prone to
think that experience is limited by our actual
horizon. We need to know that experience
has no limit save that which is set by the
limit of our imaginative insight. No door
of life is closed to the imaginative mind and
heart. The world is its playground to wander
in at will. Experience, and thorough
experience, comprehension of life is at the
command of <i>imagination</i>.</p>

<p>Life can be intelligently apprehended on
the material plane through trained senses.
Life can be vividly realized on the spirit's
plane only through a trained imagination.
It is only vivid realization of life at every
point which makes it worth living. You
may see the lark long after he is lost to my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
duller eye in our common sky, you may
hear the song when my less keen ear no
longer catches a faintest thread of melody;
but unless the eye and ear of your imagination
match mine you shall not <i>vividly realize</i>
flight or song, and so I shall follow both long
after they are lost to you. Your skylark will
pass with the moment of his rapturous song-flight,
while mine shall remain forever a
spirit of joy to be recalled at will for my
spirit's refreshing.</p>

<p>Looking then upon imagination as a key
to that comprehension of life which clarifies
and constitutes its worth, let us eagerly enter
upon the cultivation of such power. We
have left this question of imaginative development
as a definite exercise to a fifth
place in our interpretative study, not because
it is less vital to effective expression
than the first four subjects we have considered,
but because <i>balanced expression</i> is
our aim, and imagination once given free play
may easily impair that harmonious development
of all our faculties which makes for
balance in expression. Of course there is no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
phase of the study of interpretation which,
when rightly conducted, does not indirectly
or directly involve the training of the imagination.
On the other hand, training of
the imagination wisely conducted may comprehend
and carry on development along
all other lines of evolution in expression.
A sensitive imagination trained and controlled
to its highest power of apprehension
must make for sympathy and intelligence in
thought and feeling, keep humor sane, and
give direction to purpose. But imaginative
vigor set free to the uses of thought and
emotion <i>already</i> disciplined, to <i>conscious</i> purpose
and to <i>good</i> humor, becomes a safe
master of expressive living.</p>

<p>The material through which we are to
exercise the imagination and develop imaginative
vigor is the narrative form of discourse.
Narration is successful when it
records or has the effect of recording actual
experience. A story (according to the authority
we so often invoke,&mdash;Mr. Gardiner),
"whether it be as simple as those of the
Book of Genesis or as complex as Mr. James<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
or Mr. Meredith, must carry the effect of the
concreteness, and, as it were, the solidity of
life." The plot, the characters, the setting
of a story <i>which is to live</i>, must have the
vividness of real experience. This does not
mean that the creator of the story must have
actually experienced the plot, the people, and
the pictures which together make up his tale&mdash;they
may be the product of actual experience
or of imagination&mdash;but it does mean
that while he is putting these elements together
and creating his narrative he must
realize <i>as though it were actual experience</i> the
incident of his plot with the characters and
in the atmosphere of his creation. Such
realization can only come through vivid imagination.</p>

<p>Exactly the same demand is made upon
the imagination of the interpreter. When
you retell the tale of a master creator of
stories your interpretation will be convincing,
exactly as was his creation,&mdash;through
the lucid play of a vivid imagination. You
must make me feel that I am in the presence
of incidents, characters, pictures which you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
yourself have experienced. Nay, more, you
must make me feel that I myself am actually
meeting these people, seeing these pictures,
taking part in these incidents, as you relive
for me <i>in imagination</i> at the moment of your
interpretation the tale you are retelling to
me.</p>


<h4>SUGGESTIVE ANALYSIS</h4>

<p>We shall use for suggestive analysis in this
study not a complete specimen of narration,
but several examples illustrating two of the
three elements necessary to the personnel of
a good story. These three recognized elements
are the setting or situation which the
pictures compose, the atmosphere which the
characters create, and the plot or the action
in which the characters engage. We shall
leave the question of the plot to class work
upon the selections from epic poetry to be
considered later in this study.</p>

<p>Suppose we test our imaginations in the
analysis of a situation or setting before we
attempt a character study. Remember the
situation is to be realized through imagina<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>tion
as though it were actual experience. It
is to be <i>recreated</i>. Give your imagination
full play in this opening chapter of George
Eliot's <i>Mill on the Floss</i>. Let us read the
first sentence:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A wide plain, where the broadening Floss
hurries on between its green banks to the sea,
and the loving tide, rushing to meet it, checks
its passage with an impetuous embrace.</p></div>

<p>Can you see and feel the elements of this
picture! You have never experienced a tide
river? Never mind! There is enough in
the picture which <i>is</i> familiar to your actual
senses through experience to brace your
imagination for a grasp of the unfamiliar
elements. The wide plain, the river hurrying
between green banks&mdash;no apperceptive
background fails thus far in the picture.
What do we mean by apperceptive background?
Let us investigate for a moment
the psychology involved in the art of
"making pictures." Let us get back of this
word-picture. Rather let us stay this side
of it. Look at the page before you not with
the inner eye of your imagination, but with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the outer eye&mdash;the eye which is merely the
organ of the sense of sight. Use your eye
as a physical sense only. What does your
eye carry to your mind when you look at this
page? "Black letters grouped into words on
a white surface." Did you get all these qualities
at once? Yes, because you have seen other
printed pages. Can you wipe out of your mind
your knowledge of paper, print, and words?
Can you imagine looking on such a page
as this for the first time&mdash;<i>perceiving</i> it for
the first time? If you can do this you will
arrive at an understanding of apperceptive
background through its elimination. You
will realize, that all that is in the back of
your mind, stored there by its previous acquaintance
with other printed pages, makes
up the apperceptive background by which
you get a conception of this page. That
conception comes first through your physical
sense of sight. You may perceive also
through touch, through feeling, for instance,
the quality of paper. But all that you perceive
in this initial process,&mdash;the stimulus
which comes through the physical senses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
yields little to the complete conception as
compared with the yield of your so-called
<i>mental senses</i>. It is when you have fully
apperceived the object that your conception
is complete. It is when you have brought
to bear upon this page (still looked upon,
remember, merely as a printed page regardless
of the matter behind the print) all your
previous knowledge,&mdash;it is when you have
observed that the paper is of good quality,
that the page is closely set, that the print
is excellent, that the margin is wide,&mdash;it is
when you have compared it in memory with
other pages in other books,&mdash;it is when you
have not only perceived but <i>ap</i>perceived it
that you have really gained a conception of
it. Of course, if you are a type-setter, or a
proof-reader, or a printer, or an editor, or
one connected with book-making in any
least or last capacity, you will see a printed
page quite lost to me, because your apperceptive
background will outmatch mine as
to paper, print, margin, and type. Good!
I yield to you from type-setter to editor! But
I challenge you to another contest over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
same page. Match with me now conceptions
gained from another view of this same printed
matter. Forget now type, paper, margins,
and words&mdash;yes, forget the words as printed
words&mdash;look back of them with me. What
do you see now on the page? Still words?
Look behind them at the pictures! Now,
what do you see? "A wide plain, a river,
green banks, the sea!" Yes, but I see more
than that! And you do, too? "The river
flows between green banks?" You have missed
a point. How does she flow? Ah, yes,
"She hurries on." Where? "To the sea!"
Yes! And what meets her? "The tide!"
Yes, the loving tide meets her! But how?
"Rushing, he checks her passage in an impetuous
embrace!" "You <i>see</i> all this!" you
say. Yes, but do you hear it, smell it, taste
it, feel it? Are you, too, caught up in that
impetuous embrace? No? Ah, then your
imagination is only half awake. No, it is
not a question of background or actual experience
now. There are enough familiar
elements, as I have said before, to rouse your
senses to <i>vividly realize</i> the picture as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
whole if you will not shut the door to such
realization&mdash;that door is your imagination.
Open it! Open it! Now I shall close the
book and ask the class to do likewise, while
you read once more <i>to us</i> these first sentences,
paint for us this picture. Yes, now you are
using your imagination to stimulate my
senses and awake my imagination, but you
must take heed. You must let me enjoy
this picture as a whole. You must let me
see, feel, taste, smell, all "in the same
breath." Remember it is a picture. Don't
disregard its perspective. Let all the elements
rest in proper relation one to another
and to the whole&mdash;as George Eliot placed
them when she made the setting. The atmosphere
is on the whole full of peace. The
river "hurries," <i>but</i> the "plain is wide";
the tide "rushes," but it is a "<i>loving</i> tide,"
even though its embrace be "impetuous."
Try it once more! Is there not the joy of
creation in such interpretation? Let us read
on! You read to us still.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On this mighty tide the black ships&mdash;laden
with the fresh-scented fir-planks, with rounded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>sacks of oil-bearing seed, or with dark glitter
of coal&mdash;are borne along to the town of St. Ogg's,
which shows its aged, fluted red roofs and the
broad gables of its wharves between the low
wooded hill and the river-brink, tingeing the
water with a soft purple hue under the transient
glance of this February sun. Far away on each
hand stretch the rich pastures and the patches
of dark earth, made ready for the seed of broad-leaved,
green crops, or touched already with the
tint of the tender-bladed autumn-sown corn.
There is a remnant still of the last year's golden
clusters of beehive ricks rising at intervals beyond
the hedgerows; and everywhere the hedgerows
are studded with trees: the distant ships
seem to be lifting their masts and stretching
their red-brown sails close among the branches
of the spreading ash. Just by the red-roofed
town the tributary Ripple flows with a lively
current into the Floss. How lovely the little
river is, with its dark, changing wavelets! It
seems to me like a living companion while I
wander along the bank and listen to its low,
placid voice, as to the voice of one who is dear
and loving. I remember these large, dipping
willows. I remember the stone bridge.</p>

<p>And this is Dorlcote Mill. I must stand a
minute or two here on the bridge and look at
it, though the clouds are threatening, and it is
far on in the afternoon. Even in this leafless
time of departing February it is pleasant to
look at&mdash;perhaps the chill, damp season adds
a charm to the trimly kept, comfortable dwell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>ing-house,
as old as the elms and chestnuts that
shelter it from the northern blast. The stream
is brimful now, and lies high in this little withy
plantation, and half drowns the grassy fringe
of the croft in front of the house. As I look
at the full stream, the vivid grass, the delicate
bright-green powder softening the outline of
the great trunks and branches that gleam from
under the bare purple boughs, I am in love
with moistness, and envy the white ducks that
are dipping their heads far into the water here
among the withes, unmindful of the awkward
appearance they make in the drier world
above.</p>

<p>The rush of the water and the booming of the
mill bring a dreamy deafness, which seems to
heighten the peacefulness of the scene. They
are like a grand curtain of sound, shutting one
out from the world beyond. And now there is
the thunder of the huge covered wagon coming
home with sacks of grain. That honest wagoner
is thinking of his dinner, getting sadly dry in
the oven at this late hour; but he will not touch
it till he has fed his horses&mdash;the strong, submissive,
meek-eyed beasts, who, I fancy, are
looking mild reproach at him from between
their blinkers, that he should crack his whip
at them in that awful manner, as if they needed
that hint! See how they stretch their shoulders
up the slope toward the bridge, with all the
more energy because they are so near home!
Look at their grand shaggy feet, that seem to
grasp the firm earth, at the patient strength of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>their neck, bowed under the heavy collar, at the
mighty muscles of their struggling haunches!
I should like well to hear them neigh over their
hardly earned feed of corn, and see them, with
their moist necks freed from the harness, dipping
their eager nostrils into the muddy pond.
Now they are on the bridge, and down they go
again at a swifter pace, and the arch of the covered
wagon disappears at the turning behind
the trees.</p>

<p>Now I can turn my eyes toward the mill
again, and watch the unresting wheel sending
out its diamond jets of water. That little girl
is watching it too: she has been standing on
just the same spot at the edge of the water ever
since I paused on the bridge. And that queer
white cur with the brown ear seems to be leaping
and barking in ineffectual remonstrance with the
wheel; perhaps he is jealous, because his playfellow
in the beaver bonnet is so rapt in its
movement. It is time the little playfellow
went in, I think; and there is a very bright fire
to tempt her: the red light shines out under
the deepening gray of the sky. It is time, too,
for me to leave off resting my arms on the cold
stone of this bridge.</p>

<p>Ah, my arms are really benumbed. I have
been pressing my elbows on the arms of my
chair and dreaming that I was standing on the
bridge in front of Dorlcote Mill, as it looked one
February afternoon many years ago. Before I
dozed off, I was going to tell you what Mr. and
Mrs. Tulliver were talking about as they sat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>by the bright fire in the left-hand parlor on that
very afternoon I have been dreaming of.</p></div>

<p>If, in your interpretation of this passage,
a sensitive imagination free, but controlled
by vital thought and intelligent feeling, has
found in trained instruments a lucid channel
for expression, then, at the close of your
reading, <i>we</i>, your auditors, shall find our
arms really benumbed from pressing our elbows
on the arms of our chairs as we dream
with you that we are standing on the bridge
in front of Dorlcote Mill&mdash;the Mill on the
Floss, which we find on awakening is but the
title and setting of a great author's great
story.</p>

<p>We turn now to the second element of
Narration&mdash;the <i>characters</i>. The setting we
have just analyzed has introduced us to the
main characters of a great story. Our interest
is already awake to the little girl who
has been watching with us the unresting
wheel of the mill. Why not take Maggie
Tulliver for our character study? To follow
Maggie but a little way is to find Tom.
This is well for us, because we need to study<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
both types. Let us read from the chapter
called "Tom Comes Home" in the life of the
boy and girl.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>TOM COMES HOME</p><p>Tom was to arrive early in the afternoon, and
there was another fluttering heart besides Maggie's
when it was late enough for the sound of
the gig-wheels to be expected; for if Mrs.
Tulliver had a strong feeling, it was fondness
for her boy. At last the sound came&mdash;that
quick light bowling of the gig-wheels&mdash;and in
spite of the wind, which was blowing the clouds
about, and was not likely to respect Mrs. Tulliver's
curls and cap-strings, she came outside the
door, and even held her hand on Maggie's
offending head, forgetting all the griefs of the
morning.</p>

<p>"There he is, my sweet lad! But Lord ha'
mercy! he's got never a collar on; it's been lost
on the road, I'll be bound, and spoiled the set."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tulliver stood with her arms open;
Maggie jumped first on one leg and then on the
other; while Tom descended from the gig, and
said, with masculine reticence as to the tender
emotions, "Hallo! Yap&mdash;what! are you there?"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he submitted to be kissed willingly
enough, though Maggie hung on his neck
in rather a strangling fashion, while his blue-gray
eyes wandered toward the croft and the
lambs and the river, where he promised himself
that he would begin to fish the first thing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>to-morrow morning. He was one of those lads
that grow everywhere in England and at
twelve or thirteen years of age look as much
alike as goslings&mdash;a lad with light-brown hair,
cheeks of cream and roses, full lips, indeterminate
nose and eyebrows&mdash;a physiognomy in
which it seems impossible to discern anything
but the generic character of boyhood; as different
as possible from poor Maggie's phiz, which
Nature seemed to have molded and colored
with the most decided intention. But that
same Nature has the deep cunning which hides
itself under the appearance of openness, so that
simple people think they can see through her
quite well, and all the while she is secretly preparing
a refutation of their confident prophecies.
Under these average boyish physiognomies that
she seems to turn off by the gross, she conceals
some of her most rigid, inflexible purposes, some
of her most unmodifiable characters; and the
dark-eyed, demonstrative, rebellious girl may
after all turn out to be a passive being compared
with this pink-and-white bit of masculinity with
the indeterminate features.</p>

<p>"Maggie," said Tom, confidentially, taking
her into a corner as soon as his mother was gone
out to examine his box, and the warm parlor
had taken off the chill he had felt from the long
drive, "you don't know what I've got in <i>my</i>
pockets," nodding his head up and down as a
means of rousing her sense of mystery.</p>

<p>"No," said Maggie. "How stodgy they look,
Tom! Is it marls (marbles) or cobnuts?"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>Maggie's heart sank a little, because Tom always
said it was "no good" playing with <i>her</i>
at those games&mdash;she played so badly.</p>

<p>"Marls! no; I've swopped all my marls with
the little fellows, and cobnuts are no fun, you
silly, only when the nuts are green. But see
here!" He drew something half out of his right-hand
pocket.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said Maggie, in a whisper. "I
can see nothing but a bit of yellow."</p>

<p>"Why, it's ... a ... new ... guess, Maggie."</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>can't</i> guess, Tom," said Maggie, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Don't be a spitfire, else I won't tell you,"
said Tom, thrusting his hand back into his
pocket and looking determined.</p>

<p>"No, Tom," said Maggie, imploringly, laying
hold of the arm that was held stiffly in the
pocket. "I'm not cross, Tom; it was only because
I can't bear guessing. <i>Please</i> be good to
me."</p>

<p>Tom's arm slowly relaxed, and he said, "Well,
then, it's a new fish-line&mdash;two new uns&mdash;one for
you, Maggie, all to yourself. I wouldn't go
halves in the toffee and ginger-bread on purpose
to save the money; Gibson and Spouncer fought
with me because I wouldn't. And here's hooks&mdash;see
here! I say, <i>won't</i> we go and fish to-morrow
down by Round Pool? And you shall
catch your own fish, Maggie, and put the worms
on, and everything&mdash;won't it be fun?"</p>

<p>Maggie's answer was to throw her arms
around Tom's neck and hug him, and hold her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>cheek against his without speaking, while he
slowly unwound some line, saying, after a pause:</p>

<p>"Wasn't I a good brother, now, to buy you a
line all to yourself? You know, I needn't have
bought it if I hadn't liked."</p>

<p>"Yes, very, very good. I <i>do</i> love you, Tom."</p>

<p>Tom had put the line back in his pocket, and
was looking at the hooks one by one, before he
spoke again.</p>

<p>"And the fellows fought me because I wouldn't
give in about the toffee."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I wish they wouldn't fight at
your school, Tom. Didn't it hurt you?"</p>

<p>"Hurt me? no," said Tom, putting up the
hooks again, taking out a large pocket-knife,
and slowly opening the largest blade, which he
looked at meditatively as he rubbed his finger
along it. Then he added:</p>

<p>"I gave Spouncer a black eye, I know&mdash;that's
what he got by wanting to leather <i>me</i>; I wasn't
going to go halves because anybody leathered
me."</p>

<p>"Oh, how brave you are, Tom! I think
you're like Samson. If there came a lion roaring
at me, I think you'd fight him&mdash;wouldn't
you, Tom?"</p>

<p>"How can a lion come roaring at you, you
silly thing? There's no lions only in the shows."</p>

<p>"No; but if we were in the lion countries&mdash;I
mean, in Africa, where it's very hot&mdash;the lions
eat people there. I can show it to you in the
book where I read it."</p>

<p>"Well, I should get a gun and shoot him."</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
<p>"But if you hadn't got a gun&mdash;we might have
gone out, you know, not thinking, just as we
go fishing; and then a great lion might run toward
us roaring, and we couldn't get away from
him. What should you do, Tom?"</p>

<p>Tom paused, and at last turned away contemptuously,
saying: "But the lion <i>isn't</i> coming.
What's the use of talking?"</p>

<p>"But I like to fancy how it would be," said
Maggie, following him. "Just think what you
would do, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother, Maggie! you're such a
silly&mdash;I shall go and see my rabbits."</p>

<p>Maggie's heart began to flutter with fear.
She dared not tell the sad truth at once, but she
walked after Tom in trembling silence as he
went out, thinking how she could tell him the
news so as to soften at once his sorrow and
anger; for Maggie dreaded Tom's anger of all
things&mdash;it was quite a different anger from her
own.</p>

<p>"Tom," she said, timidly, when they were
out-of-doors, "how much money did you give
for your rabbits?"</p>

<p>"Two half-crowns and a sixpence," said Tom,
promptly.</p>

<p>"I think I've got a great deal more than that
in my steel purse up-stairs. I'll ask mother to
give it you."</p>

<p>"What for?" said Tom. "I don't want <i>your</i>
money, you silly thing. I've got a great deal
more money than you, because I'm a boy. I
always have half-sovereigns and sovereigns for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>my Christmas boxes, because I shall be a man,
and you only have five-shilling pieces, because
you're only a girl."</p>

<p>"Well, but, Tom&mdash;if mother would let me
give you two half-crowns and a sixpence out of
my purse to put into your pocket to spend,
you know, and buy some more rabbits with
it?"</p>

<p>"More rabbits? I don't want any more."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Tom, they're all dead."</p>

<p>Tom stopped immediately in his walk and
turned round toward Maggie. "You forgot to
feed 'em, then, and Harry forgot?" he said, his
color heightening for a moment, but soon subsiding.
"I'll pitch into Harry&mdash;I'll have him
turned away. And I don't love you, Maggie.
You sha'n't go fishing with me to-morrow.
I told you to go and see the rabbits every day."
He walked on again.</p>

<p>"Yes. But I forgot&mdash;and I couldn't help it,
indeed, Tom. I'm so very sorry," said Maggie,
while the tears rushed fast.</p>

<p>"You're a naughty girl," said Tom, severely,
"and I'm sorry I bought you the fish-line. I
don't love you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, it's very cruel," sobbed Maggie.
"I'd forgive you if <i>you</i> forgot anything&mdash;I
wouldn't mind what you did&mdash;I'd forgive you
and love you."</p>

<p>"Yes, you're a silly; but I never <i>do</i> forget
things&mdash;<i>I</i> don't."</p>

<p>"Oh, please forgive me, Tom; my heart will
break," said Maggie, shaking with sobs, clinging
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>to Tom's arm, and laying her wet cheek on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>Tom shook her off, and stopped again, saying
in a peremptory tone: "Now, Maggie, you just
listen. Aren't I a good brother to you?"</p>

<p>"Ye-ye-es," sobbed Maggie, her chin rising
and falling convulsively.</p>

<p>"Didn't I think about your fish-line all this
quarter, and mean to buy it, and saved my
money o' purpose, and wouldn't go halves in
the toffee, and Spouncer fought me because I
wouldn't?"</p>

<p>"Ye-ye-es ... and I ... lo-lo-love you so,
Tom."</p>

<p>"But you're a naughty girl. Last holidays
you licked the paint off my lozenge-box, and the
holidays before that you let the boat drag my
fish-line down when I set you to watch it, and
you pushed your head through my kite, all for
nothing."</p>

<p>"But I didn't mean," said Maggie; "I couldn't
help it."</p>

<p>"Yes, you could," said Tom, "if you'd minded
what you were doing. And you're a naughty
girl, and you sha'n't go fishing with me to-morrow."</p>

<p>With this terrible conclusion, Tom ran away
from Maggie toward the mill, meaning to greet
Luke there, and complain to him of Harry.</p>

<p>Maggie stood motionless, except from her sobs,
for a minute or two; then she turned round and
ran into the house, and up to her attic, where
she sat on the floor, and laid her head against
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>the worm-eaten shelf, with a crushing sense of
misery. Tom was come home, and she had
thought how happy she should be&mdash;and now he
was cruel to her. What use was anything, if
Tom didn't love her? Oh, he was very cruel!
Hadn't she wanted to give him the money, and
said how very sorry she was? She knew she
was naughty to her mother, but she had never
been naughty to Tom&mdash;had never <i>meant</i> to be
naughty to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, he is cruel!" Maggie sobbed aloud, finding
a wretched pleasure in the hollow resonance
that came through the long empty space of the
attic. She never thought of beating or grinding
her Fetish; she was too miserable to be angry.</p>

<p>These bitter sorrows of childhood! when sorrow
is all new and strange, when hope has not
yet got wings to fly beyond the days and weeks,
and the space from summer to summer seems
measureless.</p></div>

<p>This text furnishes an easier exercise in
interpretation, does it not? It does not require
a great stretch of imagination to slip
back five, ten, a dozen years to play with
these children. But I cannot let you <i>play</i>
with them. We want to meet and know
them. The task for your imagination is not
so simple as you think. It is called upon to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>engage in character interpretation. You
cannot be allowed to merely watch Maggie
and Tom play, or even to play with them.
You must use your imagination to get inside
the minds, hearts, souls of this boy and girl
and reveal them to us. You must relive this
scene for us, becoming first Maggie and then
Tom. This exercise of your imagination belongs
in its final and complete stage to the
next and last of our studies, and to work
on the drama; so we shall not demand too
much of you along this line here, and I shall
confine my suggestive analysis of the text
to the following questions:</p>

<p>Define the relation existing between this
brother and sister indicated by this scene.</p>

<p>Is this scene typical of their relation?</p>

<p>Is it a relation likely to obtain throughout
their lives? Why?</p>

<p>Define the dispositions of these two children
by applying to each three adjectives.</p>

<p>Will Maggie or Tom make the sacrifices
inevitable to such a relation?</p>

<p>Characterize as to inflection and tone-color
Maggie's voice and Tom's. (If your
use of this book has been intelligently di<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>rected
you have already made a study of
these two elements of a vocal vocabulary&mdash;<i>inflection</i>
and <i>tone-color</i>.)</p>

<p>Answer these questions and re-read the scene.</p>


<h4>SELECTIONS FOR INTERPRETATION</h4>

<p>The following selections were chosen for
this study with a double concern in the
choice,&mdash;concern for the development of
imaginative vigor in vocal interpretation;
concern for the development of a sense of
plot in narrative composition. The demand
upon the interpreter of any of these poems,
for sensitive progressive play of imagination,
in carrying an auditor through a series of
events up to a critical issue, cannot fail to
develop, with imaginative vigor, a new sensitiveness
of creative instinct to the third
element in narrative,&mdash;action.</p>

<p>Your imagination given free play can no
more carry the "good news" from Ghent to
Aix on this wild ride, and in the feat fail to
outgrow all its former dimensions, than could
the heart of Roland's master remain untouched
in actually performing the feat itself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<span class="i0">Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into the midnight we galloped abreast.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rebuckled the check-strap, chained slacker the bit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At Duffeld, 'twas morning as plain as could be;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To stare through the mist at us galloping past;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With resolute shoulders, each butting away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one eye's black intelligence,&mdash;ever that glance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the thick heavy spume-flakes which aye and anon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By Hasselt, Dirck groaned; and cried Joris, "Stay spur!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll remember at Aix"&mdash;for one heard the quick wheeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering knees,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Called my Roland his pet-name, my horse without peer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><p>KING VOLMER AND ELSIE</p>
<p><i>After the Danish of Christian Winter</i></p><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where, over heathen doom-rings and gray stones of the Horg,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In its little Christian city stands the church of Vordingborg,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In merry mood King Volmer sat, forgetful of his power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As idle as the Goose of Gold that brooded on his tower.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Out spake the king to Henrik, his young and faithful squire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Dar'st trust thy little Elsie, the maid of thy desire?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Of all the men in Denmark she loveth only me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As true to me is Elsie as thy Lily is to thee."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Loud laughed the king: "To-morrow shall bring another day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I myself will test her; she will not say me nay."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereat the lords and gallants, that round about him stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wagged all their heads in concert and smiled as courtiers should.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The gray lark sings o'er Vordingborg, and on the ancient town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the tall tower of Valdemar the Golden Goose looks down:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The yellow grain is waving in the pleasant wind of morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wood resounds with cry of hounds and blare of hunter's horn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the garden of her father little Elsie sits and spins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, singing with the early birds, her daily task begins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gay tulips bloom and sweet mint curls around her garden-bower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she is sweeter than the mint and fairer than the flower.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">About her form her kirtle blue clings lovingly, and, white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As snow, her loose sleeves only leave her small, round wrists in sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below the modest petticoat can only half conceal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The motion of the lightest foot that ever turned a wheel.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The cat sits purring at her side, bees hum in sunshine warm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, look! she starts, she lifts her face, she shades it with her arm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, hark! a train of horsemen, with sound of dog and horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come leaping o'er the ditches, come trampling down the corn!<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Merrily rang the bridle-reins, and scarf and plume streamed gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fast beside her father's gate the riders held their way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one was brave in scarlet cloak, with golden spur on heel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as he checked his foaming steed, the maiden checked her wheel.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All hail among thy roses, the fairest rose to me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For weary months in secret my heart has longed for thee!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What noble knight was this? What words for modest maiden's ear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She dropped a lowly courtesy of bashfulness and fear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She lifted up her spinning-wheel; she fain would seek the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembling in every limb, her cheek with blushes crimsoned o'er.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay, fear me not," the rider said, "I offer heart and hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bear witness these good Danish knights who round about me stand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I grant you time to think of this, to answer as you may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to-morrow, little Elsie, shall bring another day."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spake the old phrase slyly as, glancing round his train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw his merry followers seek to hide their smiles in vain.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The snow of pearls I'll scatter in your curls of golden hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll line with furs the velvet of the kirtle that you wear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All precious gems shall twine your neck; and in a chariot gay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You shall ride, my little Elsie, behind four steeds of gray.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And harps shall sound, and flutes shall play, and brazen lamps shall glow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On marble floors your feet shall weave the dances to and fro;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At frosty eventide for us the blazing hearth shall shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, at our ease, we play at draughts, and drink the blood-red wine."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Elsie raised her head and met her wooer face to face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A roguish smile shone in her eye and on her lip found place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back from her low white forehead the curls of gold she threw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lifted up her eyes to his, steady and clear and blue.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I am a lowly peasant, and you a gallant knight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will not trust a love that soon may cool and turn to slight.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span><span class="i0">If you would wed me henceforth be a peasant, not a lord;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bid you hang upon the wall your tried and trusty sword."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To please you, Elsie, I will lay keen Dynadel away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in its place will swing the scythe and mow your father's hay."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay, but your gallant scarlet cloak my eyes can never bear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Vadmal coat, so plain and gray, is all that you must wear."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Well, Vadmal will I wear for you," the rider gaily spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And on the Lord's high altar I'll lay my scarlet cloak."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But mark," she said, "no stately horse my peasant love must ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A yoke of steers before the plow is all that he must guide."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The knight looked down upon his steed: "Well, let him wander free,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No other man must ride the horse that has been backed by me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Henceforth I'll tread the furrow and to my oxen talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If only little Elsie beside my plow will walk."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You must take from out your cellar cask of wine and flask and can;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The homely mead I brew you may serve a peasant-man."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Most willingly, fair Elsie, I'll drink that mead of thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave my minstrel's thirsty throat to drain my generous wine."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now break your shield asunder, and shatter sign and boss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmeet for peasant-wedded arms, your knightly knee across.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pull me down your castle from top to basement wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let your plow trace furrows in the ruins of your hall!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then smiled he with a lofty pride: right well at last he knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maiden of the spinning-wheel was to her troth-plight true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ah, roguish little Elsie! you act your part full well:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know that I must bear my shield and in my castle dwell!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The lions ramping on that shield between the hearts aflame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep watch o'er Denmark's honor, and guard her ancient name.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span><span class="i0">For know that I am Volmer; I dwell in yonder towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who plows them plows up Denmark, this goodly home of ours!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I tempt no more, fair Elsie! your heart I know is true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would God that all our maidens were good and pure as you!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well have you pleased your monarch, and he shall well repay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God's peace! Farewell! To-morrow will bring another day!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He lifted up his bridle hand, he spurred his good steed then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like a whirl-blast swept away with all his gallant men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The steel hoofs beat the rocky path; again on winds of morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wood resounds with cry of hounds and blare of hunter's horn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thou true and ever faithful!" the listening Henrik cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, leaping o'er the green hedge, he stood by Elsie's side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None saw the fond embracing, save, shining from afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Golden Goose that watched them from the tower of Valdemar.<br /></span>

past the rocks and shoals of Gr&egrave;ve to safe
harbor at Solidor, and remain creatively unsensitive
to the pulse of progressive action,
than could the actual rescue of his country's
squadron leave unmoved toward the "man
who did the deed" the heart of her Captain
Damfreville.</p>

<p>And when your imagination has not only
carried you through such adventure, but
stimulated <i>my</i> imagination to like activity,
there is no limit to be set to the development
which may result for us both.</p>

<p>Suggestive analysis can be of little help
at this point, the work must be done in the
class-room under direction.</p>

<p>To such stimulating exercise in the vocal
interpretation of these poems of action, I
leave you and your imagination. I shall
hope to find difficulty in recognizing either
of you at our next meeting. Like Mr.
Rhoades's<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> pupil when he emerged from the
Ninth book of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, you ought to
have "outgrown all your present intellectual
clothes" in the study of these stories in
verse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>
<p>As further material for this study there is
no better choice to be made than Tennyson's
great quasi-epic, <i>The Idylls of the King</i>,
from which but for lack of space we should
have printed selections. The following suggestions
for work in composition at this point
are based on the <i>Idylls</i>.</p>

<p>Describe in your own words Camelot.</p>

<p>Write an imaginary scene between Gareth

<h2><a name="FIFTH_STUDY" id="FIFTH_STUDY"></a>FIFTH STUDY</h2>

<h4>TO DEVELOP DRAMATIC INSTINCT</h4>


<p>Our final study in interpretation has for
its concern the development of dramatic
instinct. The work just finished should
have left no doubt in your mind as to the
nature or value of this final step in the
training, since it has anticipated both. Development
of imaginative vigor should arouse
a latent dramatic instinct and release histrionic
power. The choice of place in these
studies for this phase of the training was
made to insure cumulative evolution resulting
in balanced expression. As imagination
needs to safeguard her freedom with
sympathetic thought and intelligent emotion,
so dramatic instinct needs the guidance of a
vigorous but trained imagination. Dramatic
instinct so directed should achieve skill in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
interpreting drama and lead to distinction
in the art of acting. The immediate evolution
should be a clarified vision of life. Your
final attainment from this theory should be
distinction in the art of living.</p>

<p>With dramatic instinct capable of such
achievement, let us proceed to exercise it in
the material chosen for this study,&mdash;dramatic
literature. The natural transition from
story to play, from narrative to drama, is by
way of the monologue. Some discussion with
suggestive analysis of this form is necessary
in order to impress upon you the difference
between suggestive impersonation and actual
impersonation or characterization, leading to
a clear understanding of the difference between
reading a play and acting in one; but
the final evolution of interpretative power
must come through acted drama,&mdash;through
taking part in a play.</p>

<p>The dictionary in defining the monologue
authorizes three forms: (1) when the actor
tells a continuous story in which he is the
chief character, referring to the others as
absent; (2) when he assumes the voice or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
manner of several characters successively;
(3) more recently, when he implies that the
others are present, leading the audience to
imagine what they say by his replies. Browning
created this more recent form, which is
the most vital of the three. I have chosen
for your study of the monologue examples
from Browning alone. To interpret effectively
any one of the Browning monologues will
call into play every element of power in
voice and expression which you have gained
in your study of previous forms. You must
think vividly, feel intelligently, realize and
suggest an atmosphere, sustain a situation,
and keep the beauty of the poetic form.
And you must do all this <i>in the person of another</i>.
The new demand which the monologue
makes is impersonation. Let us see
just what we mean by impersonation. It is
the art of identifying one's self with the
character to be portrayed. It is the art of
losing one's self in the character and the
situation the dramatist has created. This
means that the spirit of the character must
take possession of the impersonator, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>form
his every thought and feeling, and so
his every motion and tone. Remember, it
is the <i>spirit</i> of the character that must determine
the nature of the tone and gesture.
The great danger in entering upon the study
of impersonation lies in emphasizing the outward
manifestation instead of the inward
spirit of the character to be portrayed. If
you really sense the soul, mind, heart quality
of the character you are to present, and have
made your voice and body free agents for
the manifestation of those qualities, your impersonation
will be convincing. If the spirit
of the <i>Patriot</i> or <i>Andrea del Sarto</i> or <i>Fra
Lippo Lippi</i> or <i>Pompilia</i> or <i>Caponsacchi</i> or
<i>Guido</i> obsesses you, the outward manifestation
will take care of itself&mdash;always provided
your instruments are responsive. Don't begin
with the outward manifestation. Don't
say I think this man would frown a great
deal, or fold his arms over his breast, or use
an eyeglass, or strut, or stoop, or do any
one of a hundred things which, if repeated a
half-dozen times during an impersonation,
may become a mannerism and get between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the audience and the spirit of the character.
When you are studying a character for the
purpose of impersonation determine first to
what type it belongs. Then study that type,
wherever you are. Daily life becomes your
teacher and studio. When you enter upon
this art there are no longer dull moments in
railroad stations or trains, in shops or in the
social whirl. Everywhere and always you
are the student seeking to know and understand
types of people better, that you may
use your knowledge in presenting to an audience
an individual. When you have caught
the spirit of the individual you must realize
the situation out of which this particular
individual speaks.</p>

<p>Let us make a special study of the <i>Tale</i>
(Browning's epilogue to <i>The Two Poets of
Croisic</i>). It is perhaps the most exquisite
of the poet's creations in this field. The situation
reveals a young girl recalling to her
poet lover an old Greek tale he had once told
her. There is a suggestion from some critics
that Browning has drawn his wife in this portrait,
and through it pays his tribute to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
This immediately affords us a clue to the
type of character to which the speaker belongs.
We cannot hope (nor do we wish) to
impersonate Mrs. Browning, but a knowledge
of Mrs. Browning and her relation to her
poet lover, gained through a study of her
<i>Letters and Sonnets</i>, will lead us more quickly
to a comprehension of the speaker and
situation in the <i>Tale</i>.</p>

<p>Obsessed by the spirit of the character and
fully realizing the situation, our next step is,
<i>in imagination</i>, to set the stage. This is an
important point in presenting a monologue.
The impersonator must have a clear idea of
his position on his imaginary stage relative
to his imaginary interlocutor. But he must
remember that <i>imaginary</i> stage-setting admits
of only delicately suggestive use. This
is true of the handling of a monologue at
every point. It must be suggestive. The
actor carries to completion the action which
the monologuist suggests. The art of interpreting
a monologue depends upon the discrimination
of the impersonator in drawing
his line between suggestion and actualization<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
in gesture. The business of the monologuist
is to make an appeal to the imagination of
the audience so vivid that the imagination
of the audience can actualize the suggestion.
And the illusion is complete. What are the
relative positions of the girl and her lover
in the <i>Tale</i>? There is nothing in the lines
to make our choice arbitrary. It is only important
that we determine a relation and
keep it consistently throughout the reading.
Here is a possible "setting." They are in
the poet's study; he is working at his desk;
she is sitting in a great chair before the fire,
a book in her hand, which she does not read;
she is gazing into the flames. She begins
dreamily, more to herself than to him&mdash;"What
a pretty tale you told me." At
what point does her tone lose its reflective
quality and become more personal? Where
does she turn to him? How do we know
that he leaves his chair and comes over to
sit on the arm of her chair? What calls him
to her? What two qualities of feeling run
through her mood and determine the color
of her tone and the character of her move<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>ments.
If your study of Mrs. Browning has
been intelligent, this interplay of the whimsical
and serious in her nature cannot have
escaped you, and it will illumine now your
impersonation of this girl. It is the secret of
the peculiar charm of this creation. The
story she tells is an old and well-known one.
It is the manner of the telling through which
we come in touch with an exquisite woman's
soul that holds us spellbound. Unless the
interpreter catches this secret and reveals it
to his audience, he will miss the distinctive
feature of the monologue and reduce it to a
narrative poem.</p>

<p>Our last form for interpretative vocal study
is the play. We shall discover that the presentation
of the play makes the same demands
upon the interpreter as the monologue
with the new element of <i>transition</i>. We are
still studying the monologue, because we are
to read, not act, the play. It is still suggestive,
not actualized impersonation. But
instead of one character to suggestively set
forth we have two, three, a dozen to present.
The transition from character to character
becomes our one new problem. As we have
said before, in making the transition from
character to character, voice, mind, and body
must be so volatile that the action of the
play shall not be interrupted. I know of no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
better way to enter upon the study of a play
for reading (or acting) than to treat each
character as the speaker in a monologue of
the Browning type. The danger in transition
from character to character centers in
the instant's pause when one speaker yields
to another. The unskilful reader loses both
characters at this point and becomes conscious
of himself; the action of the play stops;
and the illusion of scene and situation is lost.
The great reader of the play (in that <i>instant's
pause</i>), as he utters the last word of
one character, becomes the interlocutor listening
to the words which he as the other
character has just uttered. In that instant
he must show the effect of the speech he has
just uttered upon the character he has just
become. Which is the greater art: to read
a play, or to act in it?</p>

<p>Use for your study of the play the Shakespearian
drama. Begin with scenes from <i>As
You Like It</i> and <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>;
but begin with actualized impersonation of
the characters. No discussion more! No
analysis more! The play&mdash;the "play's the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
thing" through which to complete this
evolution in Vocal Expression.</p>


<p class="center"><i>A FINAL WORD ON INTERPRETATION</i></p>

<p>Looking back over these studies in interpretation,
let us review in true scholastic
fashion the main points thus far discovered.
We say looking back, but as far as the
arrangement of our text goes this review
involves looking forward too. The division
of the book into three parts is purely a matter
of a necessary separation in discussing the
three activities involved in vocal expression.
If your use of this book has been intelligent,
each study in interpretation has revealed
your need to strengthen your vocal vocabulary
or to perfect your vocal technique, and
you have turned at once for the required help
to the studies in <a href="#PART_II">Part II</a> and the exercises
in <a href="#PART_III">Part III</a>.</p>

<p>Omitting a review of the <i>preliminary
plunge</i>, which was intended to "show up"
all your peculiar powers and all your especial
needs at once, and so furnish a basis for the
main work, let us see what happened in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
five following studies. It will simplify our
statement in each case to base the analysis
of our discoveries on the form of literature
employed in each study.</p>

<p>You found then (or ought to have found)
in Study One: that the essay and didactic
poem make a fundamental appeal to the
mind; that the demand upon the interpreter
of this form is for clear, concise thinking;
that your need is for a command of unerring
emphasis and purposeful inflection. You
turned to the studies in <i>pause</i>, <i>change of
pitch</i>, and <i>inflection</i> to meet that need. Returning
to the main study, you tested your
vocal skill on the essay to find the essay so
read might persuade an auditor to some readjustment
of his ideas, values, discriminations,
or strengthen him in convictions
already held.</p>

<p>Study Two revealed that in lyric poetry
the primary appeal is to emotion; that its
vocal demand upon the interpreter is for a
mastery of <i>tone-color</i>, a sense of rhythm, and
the power to suggest a background of musical
sound. Having supplied as far as possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
any lack in your vocabulary or technique by
supplementary work in Parts II and III,
returning you found that a lyric rightly read
could release in the auditor pity, forgiveness,
forbearance, endurance, understanding, love.</p>

<p>The Third Study should have convinced
you that a sense of <i>good</i> humor is a safe
and desirable thing to cultivate; that the
whimsical tone in interpretation will leaven
almost any lump of sheer learning and counteract
a serious overdose of sentiment; that
fable, fairy tale, and nonsense rhyme depend
too for successful interpretation upon this
element of whimsicality in the reader; that
the secret of the whimsical element in vocal
expression lies in a use of <i>pause</i> and <i>inflection</i>.</p>

<p>Study Four should have discovered to you
that the three elements of the short story
can only be realized through imagination;
that imaginative vigor dealing with action
requires sustained vitality of tone. Such
discovery should have resulted in many hours
of work on the exercises for <i>support</i> and
<i>freedom</i> of <i>tone</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>When you reached the Fifth and last
Study, the work in monologue and drama
should have easily awakened your dramatic
instinct and quickly released your histrionic
power. You should have learned through
monologue and drama to understand various
types of persons; to see more clearly the
relations of men and events; to more intelligently
comprehend life itself.</p>

<p>Finally, we have discovered that to become
a true interpreter of literature means to
become a lucid channel for the message of an
author to the mind of an auditor,&mdash;nay, that
it means more than that. In final evolution
the interpreter of literature becomes a revealer
of life. The final effect of literature
worth interpreting is to enlarge the world's
knowledge of life's beauty, truth, or power.
Your final concern as an interpreter is to let
life find through you uninterrupted revelation
on one of these planes; to become a
pure medium between the beauty, truth, and
power of life and the seeking soul. The
author need not be considered in this final
analysis, because you, the interpreter, first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
became identified with the author, and then
both of you are lost in the vision, save only
as either personality may enlarge or clarify
the revelation.</p>

<p>A personal experience may help you to
realize this ideal of the interpreter's art.</p>

<p>With a sense of protest, I had presented a
play I loved to an audience with which I felt
little sympathy. By chance there was in
that audience one of our best teachers and
critics. After my recital I sought his criticism.
Beginning, as the true critic always
should, with a noting of some point of power,
he said, "I congratulate you upon your
<i>illumined moments</i>, but&mdash;they are too infrequent.
You must multiply them." "What
do you mean by my illumined moments?"
I asked. "The moments when you do not
get between your audience and the thought
you are uttering&mdash;the moments when you
become a revealer of life to them. Your
attitude toward your audience is not sustained
in the simplicity and clearness of some
of its moments. You suddenly ring down
the curtain in the middle of the scene. That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
spoils the scene, you know. You seem to
feel a revolt against the giving of your confidence
to the audience, and thereupon you
immediately shut them away. You become
conscious of yourself, and we, the audience,
lose the vision and become conscious of you
and the way you are reading or reciting or
acting." Then he added, "Adelaide Neilson,
at first, had illumined moments in her playing
of Juliet, but finally her impersonation became
one piece of illumination." That delightful
teacher, reader, and critic, the late
Mr. Howard Ticknor, suggested the same
ideal in comparing a Juliet of to-day with
Miss Neilson's Juliet. "When Miss &mdash;&mdash; is
on the balcony," he said, "you hear all around
you: 'How lovely she looks!' 'Isn't that robe
dear?' 'How beautiful her voice is!' When
Miss Neilson lived that little minute, a breathless
people prayed with Juliet, 'I would
not for the world they found thee here,'
and sighed with Romeo&mdash;'O blessed, blessed
night! I am afeard, being in night, all this
is but a dream.'" Miss Neilson <i>was</i> Juliet.
They, the audience, lived with these lovers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
one hour of lyric rapture, and could never
again be quite so commonplace in their attitude
toward the "deathless passion." They
may not now remember Adelaide Neilson,
but they remember that story, and forever
carry a new vision of life and love, because
the actress lost herself in the life of
the play. She did not exploit her personality
and let it stand between the audience
and the drama. When some one says to
you&mdash;the reader or actress, "I shall never
forget the way you raised your eyebrow at
that point," don't stop to reply, but fly to
your study and read the lines "at that point"
over and over, with level brows, until you
understand the meaning, and can express
the thought so effectively by a lift of your
voice that you no longer need the help of
your eyebrow. Every gesture, every tone,
must call attention, not to itself, but to the
hidden meaning of the author. It must illumine
the text of the character portrayed.
That is it: if we would be artists (and there
is not one among us who would not be an
artist) we must cease to put our little selves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
in front of our messages. In the home, in
the office, in the houses of our friends, in the
school-room, on the platform, on the stage,
let us be <i>simple</i>, <i>natural</i>, <i>sincere</i>. Let us lay
aside our mannerisms. Let us seek to know
and reveal life. Then shall we be remembered&mdash;not,
for a queer way of combing our
hair, or lifting our eyes, or using our hands,
or shrugging our shoulders, but for some
revelation of truth or of beauty which we
have brought to a community.</p>

<h2><a name="STUDIES_IN_VOCAL_EXPRESSION" id="STUDIES_IN_VOCAL_EXPRESSION"></a>STUDIES IN VOCAL EXPRESSION</h2>

<h4>THE VOCAL VOCABULARY</h4>


<p>There is a theory that it is dangerous to go
beyond the mere freeing of the instrument
in either vocal or physical training. In accordance
with this theory I was advised by
a well-known actress to confine my study
for the stage, so far as the vocal and pantomimic
preparation was concerned, to singing,
dancing, and fencing. "Get your voice and
body under control," she said. "Make them
free, but don't connect shades of thought and
emotion with definite tones of the voice or
movements of the body; don't meddle with
Delsarte or elocution." This advice seemed
good at the time. It still seems to me that
it ought to be the right method. But I have
grown to distrust it. One of the chief sources
of my distrust has been the effect of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
theory upon the art of the actress who gave
the advice. She is perhaps the most graceful
woman on the stage to-day, and her voice
is pure music. But her gestures and tones
fail in lucidity; they fail to illumine the text
of the part she essays to interpret. One
grows suddenly impatient of the meaningless
grace of her movements, the meaningless
music of her voice. One longs for a swift&mdash;if
studied&mdash;stride across the stage in anger
instead of the unstudied grace of her glide
in swirling-robed protest. One longs to hear
a staccato declaration of intention instead
of the cadenced music of a voice guiltless
of intention. No! After the body has been
made a free and responsive agent, a mastery
of certain fundamental laws, a mastery
of certain principles of gesture in accordance
with the dictates of thought and emotion, is
necessary to its further perfecting as a vivid,
powerful, and true agent of personality. The
action must be suited to the word, the word
to the action, through a study of the laws
governing expression in action.</p>

<p>So with the voice: to become not only a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
free instrument, but a beautiful and powerful
means of expression and communication it
must learn to recognize and obey certain
fundamental laws governing its modulations.
A master of verbal expression is distinguished
by his vast vocabulary of words, and his skill
and discrimination in its use. A master of
vocal expression must acquire what we may
call a <i>vocal vocabulary</i>, consisting of changes
of pitch, varieties of inflection and variations
in tone color, and must know how to use
these elements with skill and discrimination.
Our need for such a vocabulary was discovered
to us at every step of the work in
interpretation. The suggestions and exercises
of the following studies aim to supplement
the work in interpretation by meeting
that need. Before making a detailed
study of each element of this vocal vocabulary
let us make a quick study with the four
elements in mind. Remember, in the last
preliminary exercise, as in the final complete
interpretative endeavor, the material we employ
is to be chosen from real literature. It
is to be worth interpreting whether it be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
single line or phrase or a complete poetical
drama. We have agreed to consider literature
as real literature, and so worth our interpretative
efforts, when it possesses one or
combines all of the three qualities,&mdash;<i>beauty</i>,
<i>truth</i>, and <i>power</i>.</p>

<p>This passage from Emerson's <i>Friendship</i>
surely meets that requirement. It is truth
beautifully and powerfully expressed. It
will serve.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Our friendships hurry to short and poor conclusions
because we have made them a texture
of wine and dreams instead of the tough fiber
of the human heart.</p></div>

<p>Having read this passage cursorily (as is
the custom in reading to one's self to-day),
will you now study it for a moment very
closely. Now, once more, please, read it
silently, noting the action of your mind as
you read. ("Watch its pulsations," Dr.
Curry would say.) And now, aloud, although
without an auditor, read it, this time noting
the effect of the action of the mind upon your
voice. Did its pitch change? Where and
why? How did you inflect the words "wine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
and dreams"? How did the inflection of
these words differ from that of the last six
words, "tough fiber of the human heart,"
with which they are contrasted in thought?
Did your tone change color at any point?
Why? Where? But now, once more, let us
approach the passage, this time with a different
intention. Let us study it with the
idea of interpreting it for another mind.
Now the method of attack is very different.
Not that it ought to be different. But it is.
Intense concentration ought to characterize
all our reading, whether its object be to
acquire knowledge or pleasure for one's self,
or to impart either to another. But the day
of reading which "<i>maketh a full man</i>" seems
to be long past, so far as the general public
is concerned. The necessity of skimming the
pages of a dozen fourth-rate books of the
hour in order to be at least a lucid interlocutor,
and so a desired dinner guest, is making
our reading a swift gathering of colorless
impressions which may remain a week or
only a day, and which leave no lasting
effect of beauty or truth upon the mind and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
heart of the reader. Should it not be rather
an intense application of the mind to the
thought of a master mind, until that thought,
in all its power and beauty, has broadened
the boundaries of the reader's mind and enlarged
the meaning of all his thoughts? I
wonder if a much smaller proportion of time
spent in such reading might not result in a
less <i>bromidic</i> social atmosphere, even though
its tendency were a bit serious. I think it
might be both safe and interesting to try such
an experiment.</p>

<p>But now we must return to Emerson on
<i>Friendship</i>. In studying a passage for the
purpose of vocal interpretation you have
learned that the concentration of attention
upon the thought must be intense, you must
make the thought absolutely your own before
you can present it to your auditor, it must
possess you before you can express it; that
the thought must seem in the moment of its
expression to be a creation of your own
brain, it must belong to you as only the thing
you have created can, and until you have so
recreated the thought it is not yours to give.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
Having recalled these precepts, read the passage
silently again. Pour upon it the light
of your experience, your philosophy, your
ideals, your perception of truth. Comment
upon it silently as you read. Now read it
aloud and let your voice do this commenting.
But wait a moment. Let me quote for you
the paragraph following this statement.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The laws of friendship are austere and eternal,
of one web with the laws of nature and morals.
But we have aimed at a swift and petty benefit
to suck a sudden sweetness. We snatch at the
slowest fruit in the whole garden of God, which
many summers and many winters must ripen.</p></div>

<p>This is Emerson's paraphrase of his original
statement. How much of it did your mental
commentary include? How did your silent
paraphrase resemble this? Read the original
passage again to yourself in the light of this
paraphrase. I shall ask you now to repeat
the first sentence from memory, for you will
find, after this concentrated contemplation
of a thought, that its form is fixed fast in
your mind. That is a delightful accompaniment
of this kind of reading. The form of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the thought, if it be apposite (which it must
be to be literature, and we are considering
only literature), the form of a thought so
approached stays with us in all its beauty.</p>

<p>Let us then repeat the original statement,
having read the passage in which Emerson
has elaborated it. Now, what you must demand
of your voice is this: that it shall so
handle the single introductory sentence as to
suggest the rest of the paragraph. In other
words, your voice must do the paraphrasing,
by means of its changes in pitch, its inflections,
and its variations in tone-color; by
means, in short, of its <i>vocal vocabulary</i>.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<h4>STUDY IN PAUSE AND CHANGE OF PITCH</h4>

<p>It is asserted that, "the last word has not
been said on any subject." Mr. Hamilton
Mabie seemed to me to achieve a <i>last
word</i> on the subject of <i>pause</i> when he
casually remarked: "Emerson was a master
of pause; he would pause, and into the pool<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
of expectancy created by that pause drop
just the right word." There seems little to
be added to complete the exposition of that
single sentence. It surely leaves no doubt
in our minds as to the effect to be desired
from the use of this element of our vocabulary.
How to use it to gain that effect is our
problem. First of all, we must cease to be
afraid to pause. We hurry on over splendid
opportunities to elucidate our text through
a just use of this form of emphasis, beset by
two fears: fear that we shall seem to have
forgotten the text; fear that we shall actually
forget it if we stop to think. Think
of being afraid to stop to think lest we should
stop thinking! That is precisely what the
fear indicates. It arises, of course, from a
confusion as to the real nature of pause.
We confuse pause with its ghost, hesitation.
Dr. Curry makes the difference clear for us
in his definition of hesitation as an "empty
pause." "Empty of what?" you ask. Empty
of thought! Of course, an empty pause is a
ghastly as well as a ghostly thing to experience.
If you have ever faced an audience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
in one of those "awful" moments when your
voice has ceased because your thought has
stopped, and when you are painfully aware
of a pool of embarrassed sympathy into which
you know there is no word to drop, then you
have learned the meaning of an <i>empty pause</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you shall ever face
an audience in one of those <i>fateful</i> moments
when your voice pauses because your
thought is so vital, that you realize both
your audience and you must be given time
to fully grasp it, and when you are serenely
conscious of that "pool of expectancy" into
which you know you have just the right
word to drop, then you will learn the meaning
of a <i>true pause</i>.</p>

<p>Some one has called inflection a running
commentary of the emotions upon the
thought. Emphasis might well be defined
in the same way. The definition would need
to be a bit more inclusive, since emphasis
includes inflection. Emphasis then may be
defined as a running commentary of the
thought and emotion of the reader upon the
thought of the text he interprets. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
words reveal the thought; your valuation
of that thought, as you interpret it, is revealed
through your vocal vocabulary in
voicing it. We, your auditors, can only
gather from your emphasis your valuation
of the truth or importance of what you are
uttering. You may use one or all of the elements
of your vocal vocabulary to bring out
the thought of a single phrase. The elements of
the vocal vocabulary are all forms of emphasis.</p>

<p>Since pause is a cessation of speech it can
hardly be called an element of a vocal
vocabulary; but it may rightly be called
the basis of our vocabulary because it determines
our use of the other elements. It
behooves us then to make a study of pause
before testing our vocabulary as to its other
elements.</p>

<p>Here are two texts to be valued by our
use of the pause.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>EXTRACT FROM THE DIARY OF A BOARDING-SCHOOL
GIRL</p>

<p>At midnight, the magic hour as every girl
knows for affairs of a purely private and per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>sonal
nature, when far away at the end of a corridor
you can almost hear Miss &mdash;&mdash;'s peaceful
snore, when as the poet aptly put it in this
morning's English stunt, "darkness clears our
vision which by day is sun-blind"&mdash;(I thought
Jane and I would die laughing and give it all
away when we came to that line in Mr. Lanier's
stupid poem),&mdash;well, as I say, exactly at
that hour my heart began to beat so hard I
thought it would wake Madge without the
"punch" I had promised to give her when it was
time to begin preparations for our grand spread.</p></div>


<div class="poem"><p>From Sidney Lanier's <i>Crystal</i>.</p><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At midnight, death's and truth's unlocking time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When far within the spirit's hearing rolls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great soft rumble of the course of things&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bulk of silence in a mask of sound,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When darkness clears our vision that by day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is sun-blind, and the soul's a ravening owl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For truth and flitteth here and there about<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Dry-dead and sharp, of some long-stricken tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And muse in that gaunt place,&mdash;'twas then my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the meditative dark, cried out: ...<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The same hour, <i>midnight</i>, is designated
by both girl and poet; the same two words,
"at midnight," open the confession and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
poem. A pause must follow these words
in the reading of either text, and another
pause must be made after the qualifying
phrase which immediately follows the opening
words of either text. But what a difference
in the comparative length of the pauses
demanded by the two readings! A very
different atmosphere attends an hour when
it is the time chosen for a school-girl's
escapade or set apart for a <i>poet's meditation</i>.
And the voice by its use of <i>pause</i> can preserve
or destroy either atmosphere. Try it.
Make your pauses in reading the school-girl's
text of equal length with the pauses
the reading of Lanier's poem demands. You
will find the result is that <i>overemphasis</i>
which has brought such discredit upon the
name of "elocution." I once heard a much-advertised
reader strain all the elements of
her vocal vocabulary in announcing a simple
change in her programme. I have heard more
than one reader give the stage directions,
indicate the scene setting, and introduce
the characters in exactly the same voice
and with the same use of emphasis which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
were afterward employed in the most dramatic
passages. Of course all the ammunition
had been used up before the real battle
began, and no one was in the least affected
by the firing during the rest of the engagement.</p>

<p>We have said that the use of pause determines
the use of all other elements of the
vocabulary. This is particularly true of the
<i>change of pitch</i> which immediately follows
pause. We pause before a new idea to get
possession of it; in that pause we measure
the idea, and the pitch of the voice changes
to accord with that measure. Every change
of thought causes a change of pitch, but the
degree and direction of change in pitch of
the voice depends upon the degree and
direction of change in thought values. In
the pause the mind takes time to value the
new thought, and tells the voice what change
it must make. Robert Browning affords the
best material for a study in change of pitch,
because of his sudden and long parentheses,
which can be handled lucidly by a voice
only after it has mastered this element of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the vocal vocabulary. <i>Abt Vogler</i> offers the
voice an excellent opportunity for exercise
in change of pitch. I print the first stanza
and first line of the second stanza of this
poem for your use.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Would that the structure brave, the manifold music I build,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bidding my organ obey, calling its keys to their work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Claiming each slave of the sound, at a touch, as when Solomon willed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Armies of angels that soar, legions of demons that lurk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man, brute, reptile, fly&mdash;alien of end and of aim,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Adverse, each from the other heaven-high, hell-deep removed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should rush into sight at once as he named the ineffable Name,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Would it might tarry like his, the beautiful building of mine&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Remember, you are to confine your consideration
to the one point, <i>change of pitch</i>,
not the change of pitch within a word, which
is inflection and belongs to another chapter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
but to the broad changes of pitch from word
to word, phrase to phrase, sentence to sentence,
following the intricate changes of the
thought.</p>

<p>I leave you to blaze a trail through this
forest of ideas. You must find the main
road, and then trace the by-paths which lead
away from that main road, and in this case,
fortunately, come back to it again&mdash;which
does not always happen in Mr. Browning's
"woody tracts of thought." To employ a
better figure for vocal purposes, you must
cut off the stream, the voice, and trace the
bed of this river of thought, following the
main channel, and then its branches. You
will find the main channel cut by the first
and last lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Would that the structure brave, the manifold music I build,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><p style="word-spacing: 0.75em;"><b>· &nbsp; · &nbsp; · &nbsp; · &nbsp; ·</b></p>
<span class="i0"><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Would it might tarry like his, the beautiful building of mine&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All between, beginning with the second line,
"Bidding my organ obey," and including the
last words of the eighth line, "the princess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
he loved," is a branch channel, leading away
from and coming back to the main river's
bed. But this branch channel is interrupted
in turn by its own branch leading away from
it and returning with it to join the main bed
with the last line we quote. This second
branch begins in the middle of the third line
with the words, "As when Solomon willed,"
wanders in this course for five lines, and,
rejoining the first offshoot, returns to the
main channel with the last line. Now turn
on the stream, the <i>Voice</i>, and watch it flow
into the course as traced. Analyze the reading
as to the use of pause and change of
pitch.</p>

<h4>STUDY IN INFLECTION</h4>

<p>To me, the most notable among the many
notable elements in Madame Alla Nazimova's
acting is her illumination of the text of her
impersonations through <i>inflection</i>. To an ear
unaccustomed to the "broken music" of her
speech, a word may now and then be lost be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>cause
of her still faulty English, but of her
attitude toward the thought she is uttering,
or the person she is addressing, or the situation
she is meeting, there can never be a
moment's doubt&mdash;so illuminating is the inflectional
play of her voice. The tone she
uses is not to me pleasing in quality. It
does not fall in liquid alluring cadences upon
the ear as does Miss Marlowe's, for instance.
It is always keyed high, whether the child-wife
Nora, or Hedda, omnivorous of experience,
is speaking. But this high-pitched tone
is endlessly volatile. It is restless. It never
lets your attention wander. It is never monotonous.
It is a master of <i>inflection</i>. Madame
Nazimova's emotion is always primarily
intellectual. It always proceeds from a
mind keenly alive to the instant's incident.
This intensely intellectual temperament reveals
itself through her voice in a rare degree
of inflectional agility. Recall the revelation
of Nora's soul in her cry: "It is
not possible! It is not possible!" Madame
Nazimova's conception of the mistress of
<i>The Doll's House</i> is concentrated in these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
four words&mdash;in her inflection of the last word,
I may almost say. When I close my eyes
and think of Madame Nazimova's voice I
see a grove of soft maples in early October
with the sun playing upon them, while Miss
Marlowe's tone carries me at once into the
pine woods, where a white birch now and
then shimmers its yellow leaves. Again,
the voice of the Russian actress suggests a
handful of diamonds, and the American instrument
a set of turquoise in the matrix.
The difference in these two agents of two
compelling personalities is, of course, the result
of a difference in the two temperaments;
but undoubtedly it also arises from a difference
in methods of training. Whatever
the temperament, light and shade can be
developed in the voice through practice of
inflection; and whatever the temperament,
a pure tone can be secured through a mastery
of support of breath and freedom of vocal
conditions. The voices of these two actresses
vividly illustrate these two points. We shall
study how to secure Miss Marlowe's tone.
We are now to work for Madame Nazimova's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
light and shade, so far as a mastery of inflection
will secure it. How shall we proceed?</p>

<p>"All my life," writes Ellen Terry, in her
entrancing memoirs, "the thing which has
struck me as wanting on the stage is variety.
Some people are tone-deaf, and they find it
physically impossible to observe the law of
contrasts. But even a physical deficiency
can be overcome by that faculty of taking
infinite pains." That is the secret of successful
acquisition in any direction, is it not&mdash;the
<i>faculty of taking infinite pains</i>? With
Ellen Terry it resulted in a voice which in
its prime estate suggested, it is said, all the
riotous colors of all the autumns, or Henry
Ward Beecher's most varied collection of
precious stones. We can secure an approximate
result by employing the same method.
Let us proceed with infinite pains to practise,
practise, practise inflection.</p>

<p>Let us first examine this <i>change of pitch
within a word</i> which we call inflection. How
does the pitch change, and why, and what
does the change indicate? We have dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>covered
that a change of thought results
in a broad change of pitch from word to
word, phrase to phrase, sentence to sentence,
and we shall discover that a change in emotion
results in a change in the color of the
tone we are using; but this element of our
vocal vocabulary, inflection, is subtler than
either of the other two. While change of
pitch is an intellectual modulation, and variation
in tone-color is an emotional modulation,
<i>inflection</i>, in a degree, combines both. It
is a change in both color and key within the
word. It is primarily of intellectual significance,
but it also reveals certain temperamental
characteristics which cannot be disassociated
with emotion. For instance, the
staccato utterance of Mrs. Fiske is technically
the result of her use of straight, swift-falling
inflections, but it is temperamentally
the result of thinking and feeling in terms
of Becky Sharp.</p>

<p>Let us see how inflections vary. They rise
and fall swiftly or slowly. They move in a
straight line from point to point, or make a
curve. (The latter we call circumflex in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>flection.)
They make various angles with
the original level of pitch, rising or falling
abruptly or gradually. These are some of
the variations, each indicating an attitude
of the mind and heart of the speaker toward
the thought, or toward the one spoken to, or
toward the circumstances out of which the
speech arises. All must be mastered for use
at will if light and shade are to be developed
in the voice.</p>

<p>Now let us take a phrase or sentence, and
voice it under a certain condition, noting the
inflection of the word or words which hold
the thought of the phrase or sentence in solution.
Then let us change the condition and
again voice the thought, noting the change
in inflection. Let me propound a profound
question,&mdash;"Do you like growing old?"
The answers will all be "yes" or "no." But
what of the inflection of those monosyllabic
words? <i>Sweet Sixteen</i> will employ a straight,
swift-falling inflection on the affirmative (unless
some untoward influence, such as "<i>Love</i>
the <i>Destroyer</i>," has embittered her life, when
she may give us one of <i>May Iverson's</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
adorable replies, masked in indifference and
circumlocution). <i>Twenty</i> will employ the
straight-falling inflection without the swiftness
of Sweet Sixteen's slide. With <i>twenty-five</i>
we detect a faint sign of a curve in the more
gradual fall. <i>Twenty-eight</i> to <i>thirty-five</i> employs
various degrees of circumflex, according
to the desire&mdash;or possibility&mdash;of concealing
the real facts. <i>Forty</i> to <i>forty-five</i>,
if in defiant mood, employs the abrupt-falling
inflection, or, if quite honest, changes to
the negative with as swift and straight a
fall. This lasts through sixty-five, and at
<i>seventy</i> we hear a new and gentle circumflex
of the "no," until the pride of extreme old
age sets in at <i>eighty-five</i> with the swift fall
of sixteen's affirmative. Were it not expedient
to maintain friendly relations with
one's printer, I should venture to diagram
these changes of tone within a word. As it
is, I shall content myself with advising you
to do so.</p>

<p>It is my privilege to have had acquaintance
with a woman who was a personal
friend of Emerson. Among the incidents of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
his delightful talk with her, retold to me, I
recall one which bears upon our present problem.
They were discussing mutual "Friends
on the Shelf." "Have you ever read <i>Titan</i>?"
asked the gentle seer. "Yes," replied the
lady. "Read it again!" said he. Query to
the class: How did the lady inflect the word
<i>Yes</i> to call forth the injunction, <i>Read it
again</i>? What did her inflection reveal?</p>

<p>However inclined we may be to quarrel
with Bernhardt's conception of the Duke of
Reichstadt, we can never forget her disclosure
of the Eaglet's frail soul through <i>inflection</i>
as she crushes letter after letter in
her hand and tosses them aside, uttering
the simple words, <i>Je d&eacute;chire</i>, and the final
revelation in the quick, thrilling curve of her
wonderful voice on the same words as the
little cousin leaves the room at the close of
this episode of the letters.</p>

<p>No better material can be chosen for a
study of inflection than the paragraph from
Emerson's <i>Friendship</i>, quoted in a preceding
chapter. Let us repeat the first sentence
again. "Our friendships hurry to short<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
and poor conclusions because we have made
them a texture of wine and dreams instead of
the tough fiber of the human heart." Study,
in voicing this, how to illumine the thought
by your contrastive inflection of the words
"wine and dreams" and "tough fiber of the
human heart." A lingering circumflex cadence
in uttering the first two words will suggest
the unstable nature of a friendship woven
out of so frail a fabric as wine and dreams,
while a swift, strong, straight-falling inflection
on each of the last six words indicates
the vigorous growth of a love rooted in the
tough fiber of the human heart.</p>

<p>In <i>Monna Vanna</i> Maurice Maeterlinck gives
the actress a superb opportunity to show her
mastery of inflection. Let us turn to the
scene in Prinzivalle's tent:<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Prinzivalle.</span> Are you in pain?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vanna.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prinzivalle.</span> Will you let me have it [her
wound] dressed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vanna.</span> No! (Pause.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prinzivalle.</span> You are decided?</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
<p><span class="smcap">Vanna.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prinzivalle.</span> Need I recall the terms of
the&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vanna.</span> It is useless&mdash;I know them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prinzivalle.</span> Your lord consents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vanna.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prinzivalle.</span> It is my mind to leave you
free....</p>

<p>There is yet time should you desire to renounce....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vanna.</span> No!</p></div>

<p>And so the seeming inquisition proceeds.
To each relentlessly searching interrogation
from Gianello comes Vanna's unfaltering reply,
in a single, swift monosyllable, "Yes"
or "No." The same word, but, oh, the revelation
which may lie in the inflection of that
word! Let us try it. Let us read the scene
aloud, first giving as nearly as possible the
same inflection to each of Vanna's answers,
then let us voice it again, putting into the
curve of the tone within the narrow space of
the two or three lettered monosyllables all
the concentrated mental passion of Vanna's
soul in its attitude toward the terrible situation
and toward the man whom she believes
to be her enemy. This is a most difficult<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
exercise, but if "a man's reach should exceed
his grasp," it will not retard our progress
toward the goal of a vocal vocabulary to
attempt it now. Apart from all aim in its
pursuit, there is no more fascinating study
than this study of inflection. In this day of
artistic photography there is an endless interest
for the artist of the camera in playing
with a subject's expression by varying the
light and shade thrown upon the face. So
for the student of vocal expression there is
endless interest in this play with the thought
behind a group of words by varying the inflection
of those words. Lady Macbeth's,
"We fail!" or Macbeth's, "If it were done
when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done
quickly," occurs to us, of course, as rich
material for this exercise.</p>

<p>In her analysis of the character of Lady
Macbeth Mrs. Jameson gives us an interesting
study in inflection, based on Mrs.
Siddons's interpretation of the words "We
fail." A foot-note reads: "In her impersonation
of the part of Lady Macbeth Mrs.
Siddons adopted successively three different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
intonations in giving the words 'we fail.'
At first a quick, contemptuous interrogation&mdash;'we
fail?' Afterward with the note of
admiration&mdash;'we fail!' and an accent of indignant
astonishment laying the principal
emphasis on the word we&mdash;'<i>we</i> fail!' Lastly,
she fixed on what I am convinced is the true
reading&mdash;'<i>we fail</i>'&mdash;with the simple period,
modulating the voice to a deep, low, resolute
tone which settled the issue at once, as
though she had said: 'If we fail, why then
we fail, and all is over.'"</p>

<p>Think how vitally the total impersonation
is affected by your choice of inflections at
this point. Compare the effects of the three,
Mrs. Siddons tested. Are there other possible
intonations of the words? What are
they? Do you realize the vital effect upon
the voice of such vocal analysis and experimentation?
Devote ten minutes of the
time you take for reading each day to this
phase of vocal interpretation, and at the
end of a week note its effect upon your silent
reading and upon your voice.</p>

<p>Remember, with inflection, as with every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
other phase of the training, the greatest immediate
benefit will come from holding the
question of its peculiar significance constantly
in mind. Study the temperament of the
people about you by noting this element in
their speech. Study the attitude of every
interlocutor you face, by studying the inflection
of his replies to the questions of life
and death you propound. But, above all,
study your own use of this element. Do
not let your own attitude go undetected.
It may help you to alter an unfortunate
attitude to realize its effect upon your own
voice.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<h4>STUDY IN TONE-COLOR</h4>

<p>And now we must turn to our last point
of discussion, tone-color. What is the nature
of this element of our vocabulary&mdash;this
<i>Klangfarbe</i>, this <i>Timbre</i>? Upon what
does it depend? You will say, "It is a property
of the voice depending upon the form
of the vibrations which produce the tone."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
True! And physiologically the form of the
vibrations depends upon the condition of the
entire vocal apparatus. <i>Tone-color</i>, then, is
a modulation of resonance. But what concerns
us is the fact that it is an <i>emotional</i>
modulation of resonance. What concerns us
is the fact that, as a change of thought instantly
registers itself in a change of pitch,
so a change of emotion instantly produces a
change in the color of the tone&mdash;if the voice
is a free instrument. And so, as before, I
want you not to think of the physiological
aspect, but to yield to the emotion, noting
the character of the resultant tone, regardless
of what has happened in the larynx to
produce that result.</p>

<p>As Browning affords us the best material
for our study in change of pitch, so the poems
of Sidney Lanier offer to the voice the richest
field for exercise in tone-color. Musician
and poet in one, Lanier's peculiar charm lies
in his unerring choice of words, which suggest
in their sound, when rightly voiced, the atmosphere
of the scene he is painting. Lanier
uses words as Corot uses colors. This gives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
the voice its opportunity to bring out by
subtle variations in <i>timbre</i> the variations in
light and shade of an atmosphere. To read
aloud, sympathetically, once a day, Lanier's
<i>The Symphony</i> is the best possible way to
develop simultaneously all the elements of
a vocal vocabulary. We shall use this poem
to-day as a text for our study in tone-color.
Let us omit the message of the violins and
heavier strings, and take the passage beginning
with the interlude upon which the flute-voice
breaks:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But presently<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A velvet flute-note fell down pleasantly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the bosom of that harmony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sailed and sailed incessantly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if a petal from a wild rose blown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had fluttered down upon that pool of tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And boatwise dropped o' the convex side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And floated down the glassy tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clarified and glorified<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The solemn spaces where the shadows bide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the warm concave of that fluted note<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhat, half song, half odor, forth did float,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if a rose might somehow be a throat; ...<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What an ideal for tone-color! Dare we
think to make it ours? We must. We must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
adopt it with confidence of attainment. Let
me quote a little further:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Nature from her far-off glen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flutes her soft messages to men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flute can say them o'er again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, Nature, singing sweet and lone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathes through life's strident polyphone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flute-voice in the world of tone.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Read this passage aloud as a mere statement
of fact, employing a matter-of-fact
tone. Gray in color, is it not? Now let
your voice take the color Lanier has blended
for you. Let your tone, like a thing "half
song, half odor," float forth on these words
and linger as only a perfume can about the
thought. Now let the tone change in color
to clarify and glorify the following message
from the flute:<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>I cannot, for lack of space, reprint the
whole flute message, but you will get the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
poem, if you have it not, and voice every
word of it, I am sure. Here are some of the
most telling lines for our present purpose:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All tree-sounds, rustlings of pine-cones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wind-sighings, doves' melodious moans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And night's unearthly undertones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All placid lakes and waveless deeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All cool reposing mountain-steeps,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their mouthpiece and leal instrument<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And servant, all love-eloquent.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You see, to voice this message a mood born
of all the "warmths and mysteries and mights
of Nature's utmost depths and heights" must
take possession of you, and you must yield
your instrument to the expression of that
mood. Then watch, watch, watch the color
of the tone change as the voice, starting with
the clear flute-note, follows sympathetically
the varying phases of Nature's face which the
poet has so sympathetically painted. And
now, after a "thrilling calm," the flute yields
its place to a sister instrument, and the tone
must change its <i>timbre</i> to the reed note of the
clarionet. In the "melting" message of that
instrument we find two passages which afford
the voice chance for a most vivid contrast in
color. Beginning with the line, "Now comes
a suitor with sharp, prying eye," read the
two descriptions which follow, lending your
voice to the atmosphere of each:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i> ... Here, you Lady, if you'll sell I'll buy:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Come, heart for heart&mdash;a trade? What! weeping? why?</i><br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span><span class="i0">Shame on such wooer's dapper mercery!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would my lover kneeling at my feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In humble manliness should cry, <i>O sweet!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I know not if thy heart my heart will greet:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I ask not if thy love my love can meet:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Whate'er thy worshipful soft tongue shall say,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I'll kiss thine answer, be it yea or nay:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I do but know I love thee, and I pray</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To be thy knight until my dying day.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The first two lines, which set forth a suit
in terms of trade, demand a hard, calculating
tone, suggestive of large silver dollars. Call
this color dull steel gray. This tone flashes
out for a moment in the white indignation
of the third line, softens and warms with the
next two lines, then grows and glows until
it reaches a crimson radiance in the last two
lines. Try it!</p>

<p>And now, with "heartsome voice of mellow
scorn," let us sound the message of the
"bold straightforward horn."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Remember your <i>key</i> is set for you,&mdash;the
color of the tone is plainly chosen for you
by Mr. Lanier. Not red nor yellow, but a
blending of the two. <i>Orange</i>, is it not? Will
not an orange tone give us the feel of heartsome
confidence behind and through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
mellow scorn of the knight's message? Try
it! Let the two primary colors, red and yellow,
enter in varying degrees according to,
or following, the emotional variation in the
thought, as the knight or the lover dominates
in the message. In the first seven
lines the tone glows with the love radiance
and the orange deepens toward red. With
the next five lines the lover yields to the
knight, and the tone flashes forth a golden,
keen-edged sword. With the thirteenth line
the tone begins in the orange on "Now by
each knight that e'er hath prayed," flashes
into yellow in "to fight like a man," softens
and deepens toward red in "and love like a
maid," and returns to the orange to finish
the horn <i>motif</i>.</p>

<p>Next in this poem which affords such a
wonderful study for tone-color we have the
hautboy's message. The color is mixed and
laid on the palette ready for use as before,
with the introductory lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then the hautboy played and smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sang like any large-eyed Child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cool-hearted and all undefiled.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Don't let the words <i>large-eyed Child</i> mislead
you. Don't, I beseech you, make the
mistake of adopting the "Little Orphan
Annie" tone with which the "elocutionist"
too often insults the pure treble of a child's
"undefiled" instrument. That is the keynote
to us for our choice of color&mdash;"cool-hearted
and all undefiled." Almost a white
tone, is it not? With a little of the blue of
the June sky? Try it. Let the blue be visibly
present in the first three lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Huge Trade!" he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Would thou wouldst lift me on thy head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And run where'er my finger led!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>turning to pure white in the next three lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once said a Man&mdash;and wise was He&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never shalt thou the heavens see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save as a little child thou be.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last voice comes from the "ancient wise
bassoons." Again there is danger. Do not,
oh! do not fall afoul of the conventional old
man's quavering tone. There is nothing
conventional about these "weird, gray-beard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
old harpers sitting on the high sea-dunes,"
chanting runes. The last words of these
introductory lines safeguard us&mdash;"chanted
runes." There is only one color of tone in
which to <i>chant runes</i>. Gray, is it not?
Yes, but a silver gray, not the steel gray of
the clarionet when she became for the moment
a commercial lover. Then in the silver-gray
tone of the philosopher, voice this
last <i>motif</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bright-waved gain, gray-waved loss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea of all doth lash and toss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One wave forward and one across:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now 'twas trough, now 'tis crest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And worst doth foam and flash to best,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And curst to blest.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The importance of a right use of tone-color
in vocal interpretation was impressed upon
a Browning class last winter. We were reading
the <i>Dramatic Lyrics</i>. The poem for the
hour was <i>Meeting at Night</i>. The tone with
which the first student attacked this exquisite
love-lyric was so businesslike, so matter
of fact, so utterly out of key, that we who
listened saw not the lover hastening to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
beloved, but a real-estate agent "out to buy"
a farm. The "gray sea, the long black land,
the yellow half-moon large and low, the startled
little waves that creep in fiery ringlets
from their sleep, the pushing prow of the
boat quenched in the slushy sand, the warm,
sea-scented beach, and the three fields" all
assumed a merely commercial value. They
were interesting exactly as would be a catalogue
of properties in a deed of real estate.
If you are not a very <i>intense</i> member of
a Browning society you will, I think, enjoy
the test of tone-color involved in reading this
poem from the contrasted standpoints of the
business man and the lover. Of course, in the
first instance you must stop where I, in desperation,
stopped the student on the words,
"a farm appears." For I defy any one to
read the last two lines in a gray, matter-of-fact
tone.</p>

<p>As was the case in our consideration of
inflection, so in this study of tone-color
there is an embarrassment of rich material
for the exercise of this element. Lanier's
<i>Sunrise</i> and <i>Corn</i>; Browning's prologue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
to <i>The Two Poets of Croisic</i>, with a vivid
contrast of color in each verse; Swinburne's
almost every line; Dante Gabriel Rossetti,
Wordsworth, Keats, Tennyson&mdash;but why
enumerate? All the colorists among the
poets will reward your search of a text for
the development of <i>timbre</i>.</p>

<p>For a final brief study of the three elements
we aim to acquire, with especial emphasis
in thought upon the last one, let us
take this prologue to <i>The Two Poets of
Croisic</i>, with its color-contrast in each
verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such a starved bank of moss<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till that May morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blue ran the flash across:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Violets were born!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sky&mdash;what a scowl of cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till, near and far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ray on ray split the shroud:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Splendid, a star!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">World&mdash;how it walled about<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Life with disgrace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till God's own smile came out:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That was thy face<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The vocal treatment of the first two verses
will be very much alike. The voice starts in
minor key, a gray monotone, in harmony
with the absence of color in the bare bank
of dull moss. The inflection of the word
"starved" must emphasize the grayness. It
must be a dull push of the tone on the first
syllable, with little, if any, lift above the
level of the low pitch on which the whole
line is spoken. With a swift, salient, rising
inflection on the opening word of the second
line, an inflection which creates expectancy
of change, the voice lifts the thought out of
the minor into the major key. I must call
your attention to the vital significance of
the use of pause at this point by simply
asking you to indulge in it. Stop after uttering
the word <i>till</i> and study the effect of
the pause. It is the pause quite as much
as the inflection, you see, which induces the
expectant attitude you desire to create in the
mind of your auditor. With the next three
words, "that May morn," the tone takes on
a bit of the warmth of early summer. A
lingering cadence on the word "May" will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
help the suggestion. With the third line the
voice begins to shine. I know no other way
to express it. The inflections are swift and
straight, but not staccato, because they must
suggest a growth, not a burst of color. The
tone on which the words are borne must be
continuous. It must not be broken off definitely
with each word, as is to prove most
effective, we shall find, in handling the third
line of the second verse. The fourth line
brings the full, glowing, radiant tone on the
first word, "violets." This tone must be
held in full volume on the last two words.
The law for beautiful speech must be observed
here. (But where should it not be
observed?) Let us recall the law, "<i>Beautiful
speech depends upon openness of vowels
and definiteness of consonants.</i>" The vowels
give volume to a word, the consonants form.
Slur your consonants and squeeze your vowels
in the three words of this line, "Violets
were born," and what becomes of this
miracle of spring? The voicing of the second
verse is very like that of the first. The
opening line demands the same gray mono<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>tone.
But the three words, "sky," "scowl,"
and "cloud," if clear-cut in utterance, as
they should be, will break the level of the
line more than the single word "starved" in
the first line of the first verse can do, or was
meant to do. There is the same swift lift
of the voice in the opening word of the second
line, the same change to the major key, the
same growing glow in the tone on the third
line, and the same radiant outburst of color
sustained through the last line. The only
difference lies in the suffusion of radiance in
the tone to suggest the coming of color to
the bank, in the first verse, and the outburst
of radiance to suggest the sudden splitting
of the clouds and the star's swift birth, in
the second verse. With the emotional change
of thought in the last verse, from a travail
and birth in nature to a human soul's struggle
and rebirth, the deepening color which
creeps into the tone indicates the entrance
of personal passion. The key does not change.
The inflections are still and straight. The tone
simply deepens and glows in the last two lines, as
a prayerful ecstasy possesses the one who reads.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE UNINTERRUPTED TONE</h4>

<p>When a rich, dramatic temperament
seeks for its instrument of expression
the control of faultless technique the result
ought to be art of the highest order. Such
is the art of Gracia Ricardo. She has translated
her English name into musical Italian,
but does her country the honor to announce
her beautiful voice as an American soprano.</p>

<p>Every tone of Gracia Ricardo's singing
voice is as absolutely free from effort as the
repeated note of the hermit thrush's song,
and her tone as pure tone has the effect of
that liquid call. But could you freight the
thrush note with knowledge of human passion,&mdash;with
throb of joy or pulse of pain, you
would get from it the effect of Gracia Ricardo's
singing of a Heine-Schubert song,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
a Schumann, Brahms, or Franz <i>lied</i>, or one of
our English ballads. It must always be a
song, for Gracia Ricardo does not exploit her
voice in astonishing vocal feats. She simply
<i>sings her song</i>. It was her wish to interpret
the <i>lieder</i> of all countries that sent her in
search of a method which would free her
voice to that high use. She found that
method, not in her own country, alas, but
in Germany, where for twelve years she has
used it in the guidance of her own voice
and that of many others. She finds the
American pupil "difficult," because "You
are so impatient of a long, quiet preparation.
You wish to try your skill at every
step of the way&mdash;and not in the privacy of
your study, but in a public's hearing." Poor
American public! How it has suffered from
this <i>impatience</i>. It is true, is it not, we
are not willing to take time to establish
a right condition for tone before using the
tone in what should be final efforts of the
perfected instrument. <i>Blessed be drudgery</i>
has not become a beatitude in the gospel of
the American artist. When it is so recog<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>nized
by the student of vocal expression
perhaps we can reclaim this great singer and
teacher, Madame Ricardo. This book would
further that end.</p>

<p>It has been my good fortune while making
this book for you to do some brief but intensive
studying under Madame Ricardo. It is
by her gracious consent that I shall leave with
you as an incentive toward the ideal for
which we are striving the two <i>watchwords</i> of
her teaching which were most potently suggestive
to me. The exercises which constitute
her method require personal supervision,
but the active principle of those
exercises for both tone production and
breath control is clearly indicated by the two
phrases "the uninterrupted tone" and "the
constant mouth-breath." These two ideas
fully sensed by a voice will work swift wonders
in its use.</p>

<p>Like Mr. Mabie's pool of expectancy, these
watchwords of the Ricardo method suggest
their own application; but let us consider
them somewhat more closely. Think then
with me of an <i>uninterrupted tone</i>&mdash;a tone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
which is not interfered with at any point in
its production. Think of a breath that flows
freely on and on, constantly reinforced, but
never interrupted&mdash;a breath that is allowed
to enter the vocal box, pass between the
vocal chords, where it is converted into tone;
yield itself to the organs of speech and controlled
by the speech process, issue from the
mouth in beautiful speech forms, in the
words which constitute a language!</p>

<p>Tracing the process of tone production in
this way, we find that three distinct steps
are involved. Even as I write the words
distinct and steps I realize their inharmony
with the idea of flowing tone. Rather then
let us say three phases in the evolution of
speech: <i>breath</i>, <i>tone</i>, <i>speech</i>. In using the
word speech to designate the final phase in
this evolution I am thinking of it in its
broadest sense&mdash;really in a sense identical
with language. With this final phase beyond
its mere initiation this book cannot
deeply concern itself. For work along this
line I must refer you to Prof. T. R. Lounsbury's
<i>Standard of Pronunciation in English</i>;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
to the article on <i>The Acquiring of Clear Speech</i>
by John D. Barry, published in <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>
for August, September, and October, 1907; to
<i>The Technique of Speech</i>, by Dora Duty Jones.</p>

<p>Not technique of speech, but <i>technique</i> of
<i>tone</i> is our study. Not how to make beautiful
speech forms, but how to make beautiful
speech-tones; not how to distinguish one
speech from another in a language, or the
speech forms of one language from those of
another, but how to distinguish interrupted
speech-tone from <i>uninterrupted</i> speech-tone&mdash;such
is our problem.</p>

<p>But tone is breath before it becomes
speech, so our first concern is with the
initial stage. The process of breath control
in the Ricardo method of tone production (as
in my own) is analogous to the process of
pumping water. Let your chest with its
lungs represent the reservoir, your diaphragm,
the great muscle at the base of the lungs,
becomes the piston and your mouth the
mouth of the pump. If the mouth of the
pump runs dry the pump itself runs down
and has to be primed. Priming a pump<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
is precisely analogous to "catching your
breath" in speech.</p>

<p>The active principle of breath control in
the Ricardo method is the idea of a <i>constant
mouth-breath</i>. A sense of uninterrupted
breath is as essential to a knowledge of correct
tone as a sense of uninterrupted tone
is to a knowledge of correct speech and song.</p>

<p>In breathing to speak or sing there must
be such perfect diaphragmatic control that
the mouth shall never be out of breath. You
must learn in speaking and reading to take
easily and quietly breath enough and <i>often
enough</i> to supply the tone which is to be
made into a single word, a phrase, a sentence,
or a series of sentences, and leave the mouth-breath
unexhausted, even unaffected. You
must never catch your breath; the breath
must pass continuously, the <i>mouth-breath</i>
remaining a <i>constant</i> quantity.</p>

<p>It was gratifying in my work with this
master of tone production to find that my
own method in the training of the speaking
voice was in accord at almost every point
with her method in the training of the sing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>ing
voice. In reprinting for you the exposition
of my own method, as set down in
<i>The Speaking Voice</i>, I have found it necessary
to make but few changes. I have
altered entirely the method of handling the
tongue. I have added a word as to the
part the lips play in the production of speech.
In the few exercises it is safe to offer under
the reinforcing of tone I have used the <i>[=e]</i>
instead of the <i>&auml;</i>, convinced that it is the
more effective vowel sound through which
to work for uninterrupted tone.</p>

<p>It was also a pleasure to find my own
instrument, through its training for speech,
adequately prepared for the work in song.
The studies which constitute <i>Part Three</i> of
this book, if faithfully attended, will fit your
voices for higher work in either art.</p>


<h4>LEARNING TO SUPPORT THE TONE</h4>

<p>Before attempting the exercises involved
in the first step, let us examine a tone in
the making, or, rather, let us feel how it is
made&mdash;for the process of tone production,
so far as it concerns us, is not of physio<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>logical,
but rather psychological, significance.
The huge tomes on the physiology
of the voice which are of vital interest to the
student of anatomy are not only of no use,
but are apt to be a positive hindrance to the
student of vocal training. A vivid picture
of the larynx or vocal cords, a cross-section
of the trachea, or a highly illuminated image
of any of the cavities concerned in the production
of that most wonderful thing in the
world, a pure tone of the human voice, is a
source of delight to the physiologist, but will
only interfere with that <i>feel</i> for the free, full
volume of sound which the student of voice
as an instrument of thought and emotion
is to make, as a first step in vocal training.
Then, not as anatomists or physiologists, but
as makers of music, let us look at, let us feel
for, a tone.</p>

<p>I am "stung by the splendor of a sudden
thought"; I desire to share it with you; the
desire causes me to take a deep breath, a
column of air rises, is converted into tone,
passes into the mouth, and is moulded into
the words which symbolize my thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Let us, without further analysis, try this.
Close your eyes, think of some line of prose
or poetry which has moved you profoundly;
let it take possession of you until you are
seized by the desire to voice it. Still with
closed eyes, feel yourself take the breath
which is to be made into tone, and then
into the words which stand for the thought.
Hold that sensation, and study it with me
for a moment. "But," you say, "the desire
to voice the thought does not seize me."
Very well, let me ask you a question. "Do
you believe in examinations?" Now your
thought was converted so swiftly into speech
that you had no time to study the conversion.
Once more, whether your answer be
Yes or No, close your eyes and feel for
the tone you are to use in making the single
word.</p>

<p>Now, a little more in detail, let us see what
happens. A thought full of emotion meets
the question, the desire to answer is born;
the need of breath to meet the desire contracts
the diaphragm (the pump); the chest
(the reservoir) fills; a column of air, pumped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
and controlled by the diaphragm, and reinforced
in the chest, rises, strikes the vocal
cords (the "strings" of the instrument),
the strings vibrate, converting the air into
sound, into tone; the tone, reinforced in all
the chambers of the head, passes into the
mouth, and is there moulded by the juxtaposition
of the organs of speech (lips, teeth,
tongue) into the word, the single, monosyllabic
word, Yes or No, which frames the
thought. Now, once more, with closed eyes,
sense the process and hold the sensation, but
do not speak the word. Now, still once
more, and this time, speak. Alas! did we
say we were "makers of music"? Is this
harmony,&mdash;this harsh, hard, breathy, strident
note? What is the trouble?</p>

<p>First of all, fundamental to all, and beyond
a doubt the secret of the dissonance, you did
not breathe before you spoke or as you spoke.
I mean, really breathe. And that is the first
point to be attacked. Breathe, breathe,
breathe! you must learn how to breathe; you
must get your pump, your diaphragm, into
working order, you must master it, you must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
control it, you must not fetter it, you must
give it a free chance to do its work. If you
are a man, you have probably at least been
fair in not tying down your pump; you have
not incased yourself in steel bands and
drawn them so tight that your diaphragm
could not descend and perform its office. Yes,
and if you are the athletic girl of to-day,
you have probably learned the delight and
benefit of free muscular action. But you
may still be suffering from the effect of your
mother's crime in this direction. It may
have sent you into the world with weakened
muscles in control of the great pumping-station
upon which must depend the beauty
of your voice.</p>

<p>But whatever the condition or the cause,
it must, if wrong, be made right. We must
learn to breathe properly, freely, naturally.
(Do not confuse <i>naturally</i> and "habitually."
In this connection these terms are opposites
rather than synonyms.) To breathe
naturally we must do away with all constriction.
We must choose between the alleged
beauty of a disproportionately small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
waist and the charm of a beautiful and alluring
voice. We cannot have both. Then,
off with tight corsets! Thank Heaven! they
are the exception and not the rule to-day.
Please note that I distinctly do not say,
"Off with corsets," but only "Off with <i>ill-fitting</i>
corsets," for which tight is but another
name. I believe, to digress a moment,
with our present method of dress, a
properly fitted corset is an absolute necessity,
except in the rare instances where a perfectly
proportioned and slender figure is also under
the control of firm, well-trained muscles.
In a first flush of rapture over the vision of
the gentle ladies of Mr. Howell's Altruria,
seen <i>Through the Eye of the Needle</i>, we feel
that we can take a step toward that paradise
by discarding the strait-laced tailored torture
the present-day costume prescribes, for the
corsetless grace of the Altrurian garment;
but our enthusiasm is short-lived, as we
realize that we are in modern America and
must make as inconspicuously gracious an
appearance as possible without violating the
conventions. So, as I say, do not discard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
the corset, which is, for the majority of women,
the saving grace of the present fashion
in dress; only see that your corset brings
out what is best in the figure God gave you,
instead of disfiguring it, as undue constriction
of any part of your body will inevitably do.
Incidentally, by this precaution, save your
voice as well.</p>

<p>But until we can be refitted, or readjust
the corsets we already wear, and the gowns
made over them, we must avoid the discouraging
effect of trying to work against the
odds of a costume which interferes with our
breathing, by making a practice of taking the
breathing exercises involved in the first step,
at night and in the morning. Five minutes
of deep, free breathing from the diaphragm,
lying flat on your back in bed at night and
before you rise in the morning, will accomplish
the desired result. The point in lying
flat on your back is that in that position
alone you can be sure you are breathing naturally,
which is diaphragmatically. Indeed,
you cannot, without great effort, and sometimes
not even then, breathe any other way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
than naturally. I cannot tell you why. I
can only say, try it and see.</p>

<p>Our first exercise, then, is to lie flat on the
back at night and in the morning, when you
are perfectly free, and, with closed eyes, take
deep, long breaths, letting them go slowly,
and studying the accompanying sensation
until it is fixed fast and you feel you cannot
lose it, but can reproduce, under any condition,
the action which resulted in that sensation.
The incidental effect of this exercise
is to make one very sleepy. Indeed, nothing
will so quickly and effectually put to flight
that foe of the society woman and business
man of to-day, insomnia, as the practice of
deep, regular natural breathing. Add counting
each respiration, and it is an almost unfailing
remedy. The only trouble for our
purpose is that it is sometimes so swiftly
soporific that we are asleep before the sensation
is fixed fast and noted in consciousness:
which is one object of the exercise. However,
should we find the prescribed five minutes
at night interfered with by coming
drowsiness, we may yield in sleepy content,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
"sustained and soothed" by the thought that
we shall be in splendid shape for the morning
practice, with which nothing must interfere,
"not headache, or sciatica, or leprosy,
or thunder-stroke."</p>

<p>We are ready now for the third exercise.
When, for five minutes in the morning, lying
flat on your back, with closed eyes, you have
taken deep, long breaths, letting them go
slowly, yielding your whole body to the act
of respiration, noting the effect and fixing
fast the sensation, as a next step you are to
stand up and repeat the operation. Still
holding the sensation (not by tightening your
muscles, or clenching your fists, or setting
your teeth, but simply by thinking the sensation,
letting it possess you), in this attitude
of mind breathe naturally, standing instead
of lying down. That is all. Don't be discouraged
if the test prove unsatisfactory at
first. Try an intermediate step. Sit on the
side of your bed, or in a straight-back chair,
and, closing your eyes and relaxing all your
muscles except those governing the diaphragm,
breathe. Now stand, well poised.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
By well poised, of course, you know I mean
with the weight perfectly balanced about the
center of gravity, which, in turn, means that
a perpendicular dropped from the highest
point of the lifted chest without encountering
any part of your body, and especially not
your abdomen (which should be held always
back, so that it is flat, if not actually concave)
will fall unobstructed to the floor, striking
a point just between the balls of your
feet. Standing thus, well poised, place the
right hand on your body, just below your
ribs at the base of the lungs, and your left
hand on your back, just opposite your right
hand; then breathe, and feel the diaphragm,
as it descends, cause the torso, in turn, to expand
from front to back, pressing against either
hand. Let the breath go slowly, controlling
its emission by controlling the diaphragm.</p>

<p>So the three exercises stand progressively
thus:</p>

<p><i>First.</i>&mdash;Breathe naturally, which is diaphragmatically,
five minutes at night. (At
first you can be sure of doing this only by
lying flat on your back.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Second.</i>&mdash;Breathe naturally, which is diaphragmatically,
for five minutes in the morning,
and note the sensation.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i>&mdash;Stand and test your newly acquired
power by trying to breathe diaphragmatically
while on your feet.</p>

<p>These three exercises constitute the first
step in the first stage of vocal training, and
that step is called <i>Learning to Support the
Tone</i>.</p>

<p>I know a little girl who, in the beginning
of her career, alarmed her parents by refusing
to utter a syllable or the semblance of a
syllable until she was three years old, when
she evidently considered herself ready for her
maiden effort at speech. Prepared she proved,
for, sitting at the window in her high-chair
one day, watching people pass, she remarked
quietly and with perfect precision, "There
goes Mrs. Tibbets." I find myself secretly
wishing it were possible for you to refrain
from speech, not for three years, but for
three weeks, while you quietly prepare for
speech by practising these three breathing
exercises. It is quite the customary thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
(or ought to be) for the teacher of voice
as an instrument of song to require of
the student a period of silence&mdash;that is, a
period in which only exercises are allowed,
and songs, even the simplest, are forbidden.
However, our only way to secure this condition
would be to go into retreat; but, after
all, one of the most encouraging things about
this work is the remarkable effect upon the
speaking voice of simply holding the thought
of the right condition for tone, <i>thinking</i> the
three exercises I have given you. It is not
so remarkable, perhaps, in the light of the
experiment recently made (I am told) in one
of our great colleges, when three men daily
performed a certain exercise, and three other
men simply thought it intensely, and the resultant
effect upon the muscles used in the
act was marvelously similar. I am half
afraid to have recalled this, lest you take
advantage of the suggestion and relax your
effort, or, out of curiosity, make the experiment.
Please don't. I offer it only
as an incentive to you, to <i>think</i> at least
of the desired condition, if you cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
every day indulge in an active effort to
attain it.</p>

<p>Please test at once the immediate effect of
this third exercise. Take the attitude I have
defined, and try once more any full-voweled
syllable. I think you will find the tone already
improved.</p>


<h4>LEARNING TO FREE THE TONE</h4>

<p>We have worked, so far, for support of
tone. We must now free the supported tone,
by freeing the channel for the emission of
the breath as it is converted into tone and
moulded into speech. We shall find that in
learning to support the tone we have gone
far toward securing that freedom; but the
habit of years is not easily overcome, and
every time you have spoken without proper
support of breath you have <i>forced</i> the tone
<i>from</i> the <i>throat</i>, by tightening the muscles
and closing the channel, thus making conditions
which must now be reformed by steady,
patient effort. Yet it is not effort I want
from you now; it is <i>lack</i> of effort. It is
<i>passivity</i>; it is <i>surrender</i>. I want you to re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>lax
all the muscles which govern the organs
concerned in converting the breath into tone
and moulding the tone into speech, all the
muscles controlling the throat and mouth,
including the lips and jaw. I want utter
passivity of the parts from the point where
the column of breath strikes the vocal cords
to where, as tone, it is moulded into the
word "No." Surrender to the desire to utter
that word. Concentrate your thought on
two things: the taking of the breath and the
word it is to become. Now, lying down, or
sitting easily, lazily, in a comfortable chair,
or standing leaning against the wall, with
closed eyes, surrender to the thought "No,"
and, taking a breath, speak. Still hard and
unmusical you find? Yes, but I am sure
not so hopelessly hard as before. What shall
we do to relax the tense muscles, to release
the throat and free the channel? At the risk
of being written down a propagandist, in the
ranks of the extreme dress-reformers, I shall
say, first of all, take off those high, tight
collars. Again, as with the corset, it is a
case of a misfit rather than too tight a fit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
If your collar is cut to fit, it need not be too
high nor too tight for comfort, and it will
still be becoming. You want it to cling to
the neck and keep the line. Cut it to fit,
and it will keep the line; then put in pieces
of whalebone, if necessary, or resort to some
of the many other devices now in vogue for
keeping the soft collar erect, but don't choke
yourself, either by fastening it too tight or
cutting it too high. But how simple it would
be if we could relax the tension by doffing
our ill-fitting corsets and collars. Alas! the
trouble is deeper seated than that.</p>

<p>It is an indisputable and most unfortunate
fact that nervous tension registers itself more
easily in the muscles about the mouth and
throat than anywhere else. So, if we live as
do even the children of to-day, under excitement,
and so in a state of nervous tension,
the habit of speaking with the channel only
half open is quickly formed, and the voice
becomes shrill and harsh. You have noticed
that the more emphatic one grows in argument
the higher and harder the voice becomes,
and, incidentally, the less convincing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
the argument. This is true of all excitement;
the nervous tension accompanying it
constricts the throat, and the result is a
closed channel. To learn instinctively to refer
this tension for registration not to the
throat, but to the diaphragm, is a part of
vocal training. This can be easily accomplished
with children, and the habit established
of taking a deep breath under the influence
of any emotion. This breath will
cause the throat to open instead of shut, and
the tone to grow full, deep, and round, instead
of high and harsh. The full, deep,
round tone will carry twice as far as the
high, harsh, breathy one. The one deep
breath resulting in the full, deep tone may&mdash;nay,
will&mdash;often serve the same purpose as
Tattycoram's "Count five-and-twenty," and
save the angry retort.</p>

<p>It is useless to regret, on either ethical or
aesthetic grounds, that we were not taught
in childhood to take the deep breath and
make the deep tone. But let us look to it
that the voices and dispositions of our children
are not allowed to suffer. Meanwhile,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
in correcting the fault in the use of our own
instruments, we shall go far toward establishing
the proper condition with the next
generation, since the child is so mimetic that,
to hear sweet, quiet, low tones about him
will have more effect than much technical
training in keeping his voice free and musical.
In the same way, the child who hears
good English spoken at home seems less dependent
upon text-books in grammar and
rhetoric to perfect his verbal expression
than the child who is not so fortunate in
this respect.</p>

<p>To insure the registration of nervous tension
in the muscles controlling the diaphragm
and not the throat&mdash;that is, to form the habit
of breathing deeply when speaking under the
influence of emotion, is our problem. The
present fault in registration will be found to
be different with each one of us, or, at least,
will cause us "to flock together" according
to the place of registration. Each must
locate for himself his own difficulty, or go
to a vocal specialist and have it located.
The tension may be altogether in the muscles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
governing the throat, or it may be in those
about the mouth. There is the resultant,
<i>breathy</i> tone, the <i>hard</i> tone, the <i>nasal</i> tone,
the <i>guttural</i> tone, the tone that issues from
a set jaw or an unruly tongue. All mean
tension of muscles somewhere, and must be
met by relaxation of these muscles and the
freeing of the channel. How to relax the
throat shall be our initial point of attack. A
suggestion made by my first teacher proved
most helpful to me, a suggestion so simple
that I did not for the moment take it seriously.
"Think," she said, "how your throat
feels just before you yawn." "Yes," I replied,
irrelevantly, "and just after you have
eaten a peppermint&mdash;that cool, delicious,
open sensation." This impressed her as significant,
but not so effective as her suggestion
to me, which I felt to be true when I began
to think of it seriously, and so, of course, to
yawn furiously. Try it.</p>

<p>Think of the yawn. Close your eyes and
feel how the deep breath with which the yawn
begins (the need of which, indeed, caused it)
opens the throat, relaxing all the muscles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
Now, instead of yawning, speak. The result
will be a good tone, simply because the condition
for tone was right. The moment the
yawn actually arrives, the condition is lost,
the throat closes; but in that moment before
the break into the yawn, the muscles about
the throat relax and the channel opens, as
the muscles controlling the diaphragm tighten
and the deep breath is taken.</p>

<p>These, then, are the first exercises in the
second step in vocal training. This step is
called <i>Freeing the Tone</i>.</p>

<p><i>First.</i>&mdash;Yawn, noting the sensation.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i>&mdash;Just before the throat breaks
into the yawn, stop, and, instead of carrying
out the yawn, speak. Repeat this fifty
times a day, or ten times, as often as you
will. Only, keep at it. Take always a single
full-voweled monosyllable; <i>one</i>, or <i>four</i>, or
<i>no</i>, or <i>love</i>, or <i>loop</i>, or <i>dove</i>, etc.</p>

<p>We cannot, in a printed consideration, touch
more in detail upon individual cases, but
must confine ourselves to these simple exercises,
which will, in general, be swiftly and
effectively remedial.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>But we must not stop with the throat,
which is but part of the channel involved in
the emission of breath as speech. There is
the tense jaw to be reckoned with&mdash;the jaw
set by nervous tension, the jaw which refuses
to yield itself to the moulding of the tone into
the beautiful open vowel and the clean-cut
consonant which make our words so interesting
to utter. It is the set jaw which, forcing
the tone to squeeze itself out, causes it to
sound thin and hard. Again, it is surrender
and not effort I want. Just as I should try
to secure the relaxation of your arm or hand
by asking you to surrender it to me, drop it
a dead weight at your side for me to lift as
I choose, so now I ask you to surrender your
lower jaw to yourself. Let it go.</p>

<p>Drop your head forward, resting your chin
on your chest. Then raise your head, but
not your chin. Let your mouth fall open.
Assume for the moment that mark of the
feeble-minded, the idiotic, the dropped-open
mouth, just long enough to note the sensation.
Place your fingers on either side of
your head where the jaws conjoin, and open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
your mouth quickly and with intention.
Note the action under your finger-tips. Now
let the mouth fall open, by simply surrendering
the lower jaw, and note this time the lack
of action under your fingers, at the juncture
of the jaws. It is this passive surrender
which we must learn to make, if we find, on
investigation, that we are speaking through
a half-open mouth held fast by a set jaw.
The set jaw resists and distorts the mould,
and the beauty of the form of the word which
flows from the mould is lost; the relaxed jaw
yields to the moulding of the perfectly modeled
word.</p>

<p>In practising this relaxation there is very
little danger of going too far, since the set
jaw is the indication of a tense habit of
thought, of a high-strung temperament, and
this habit of thought will never become,
through the practise of an outward mechanical
exercise, the slack habit of thought which
is evidenced by the loose dropping of words
from a too relaxed jaw&mdash;a habit which must
be met by quite the opposite method of treatment.
There are many exercises involved in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
vocal training which must be directed very
carefully for a time before the student can
be trusted to practise them alone; so I am
confining myself in this, as in every step we
take together, to the simple, fundamental,
and at the same time perfectly safe ones.</p>

<p>To review those for relaxation of the lower
jaw:</p>

<p><i>First.</i>&mdash;Drop the head until the chin rests
upon the breast. Raise the head, but not
the lower jaw.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i>&mdash;With eyes devoid of intelligence
and the mouth dropped open, shake the head
until you feel the weight of the lower jaw&mdash;until
the lower jaw seems to hang loosely
from the upper jaw and to be shaken by it,
as your hand, when you shake it from the
wrist, seems to be commanded by the arm,
and to have no volition of its own.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i>&mdash;Test your ability to surrender the
jaw by placing your fingers on either side
your head in front of the ears at the conjunction
of the jaws, and first open your
mouth with intention, noting the action;
then think the word No, and surrender the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
jaw to the forming of the word, noting the
action or absence of action again.</p>

<p>So much for the set jaw. Ten or fifteen
minutes a day&mdash;yes, even five minutes a day
of actual practice with the constant thought
of surrender, will reward you. Try it.</p>

<p>And still the channel is not open. There
remains that most unruly member, the
tongue. Dora Duty Jones refers all faults
of technique in speech to failure in the management
of the tongue. Miss Jones bases
her entire system upon the three words, "On
the tongue," in Hamlet's injunction to the
players: speak the speech ... trippingly <i>on
the tongue</i>. That this organ plays a vital
part in the presentation of speech is not to
be questioned; that it is the chief actor
may be disputed. But whether the tongue
is to play a main or a minor part the training
to which Miss Jones would subject it is most
interesting, and <i>The Technique of Speech</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
should belong to the library of every student
of expression. The only danger of this train<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>ing
lies in that of making the tongue a self-conscious
actor. What we require of the
tongue is that it shall act as a free agent in
modeling the perfect word. Many of the
exercises given by Miss Jones can be safely
attempted only after the preparatory freeing
of the organ has been accomplished, but
all of them will eventually repay investigation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the following drill for freeing
the tongue ought to develop the agility we
desire:</p>

<p><i>First.</i>&mdash;Combine <i>l</i> (which may be called
the tongue's pet consonant) with <i>&auml;</i> and repeat
the syllable <i>la</i> with constantly increasing
speed to form the following groups:
<i>l&auml;'</i> ... <i>l&auml; l&auml; l&auml;'</i> ... <i>l&auml; l&auml; l&auml;'</i> ... <i>l&auml;'</i> ... <i>l&auml;'</i>.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i>&mdash;Change the accent over the vowel
and repeat the exercise until all the sounds
of <i>a</i> are exhausted in combination with
the <i>l</i>.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i>&mdash;Change the vowel and repeat the
exercise until all the vowels have been used
in combination with <i>l</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i>&mdash;Change the consonant to <i>d</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
then to <i>t</i>, then <i>n</i>, and repeat the exercise.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i>&mdash;Follow these exercises on groups of
syllables with work on groups of words of one
syllable beginning with <i>l</i>, such as: <i>late</i>, <i>lade</i>,
<i>lane</i>, <i>lame</i>; <i>last</i>, <i>lack</i>, <i>lank</i>, <i>lapse</i>, <i>laugh</i>;
<i>lean</i>, <i>least</i>, <i>leak</i>, <i>leap</i>, <i>lead</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Remember, we are considering primarily
speech-<i>tone</i> and not speech form, and that
our aim in the exercise of the tongue is to
keep it from interrupting the tone.</p>

<p>And now a word must be said as to the
part the lips take in speech. It must be
only a word, because here more than at any
other point the work needs the careful supervision
of a trained ear and trained eyes.
Madame Ricardo yields to the lips control
of the tongue, as she gives to the diaphragm
control of the breath. I think she would
make <i>easily on the lips</i> rather than "trippingly
on the tongue" the controlling principle
in tone and speech. I shall give you
but one exercise:</p>

<p>Combine the speech process <i>m</i> with the
vowel <i>&#275;</i> and let the tone explode easily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
on the lips in the repeated syllable, <i>m&#275;</i>,
<i>m&#275;</i>, <i>m&#275;</i>.</p>

<h4>LEARNING TO REINFORCE THE TONE</h4>

<p>And now we turn from the second step
in the training to the third and last step&mdash;the
<i>reinforcing</i> of the supported and freed
tone. It is again a freeing process. This
time we are to free the cavities now closed
against the tone; we are to use the walls
of these cavities as sounding-boards for
tone, as they were designed to be, so reinforcing
the tone and letting it issue a resonant,
bell-like note with the carrying power
resonance alone can give, instead of the thin,
dull, colorless sound which conveys no life to
the word into which it is moulded by the
organs of speech. How shall we free these
cavities? I find myself now impatient of the
medium of communication we are using. I
want to make the tone for you. I want, for
instance, to shut off the nasal cavity and let
you hear the resultant nasal note, thin, high,
unresonant, which hardly reaches the first
member of my audience; then I want you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
to hear the tone flood into the nasal cavity,
and, reinforced there by the vibration from
the walls of the cavity, grow a resonant,
ringing, bell-like note, which will carry to
the farthest corner of the room without the
least increase in loudness. But we must
be content with the conditions imposed by
print.</p>

<p>First, you must realize that so-called "talking
through the nose" is not talking <i>through</i>
the nose at all, but rather failure to do so&mdash;that
is, instead of letting the tone flood into
the nasal cavity, to be reinforced there by
striking against the walls of the cavity, which
act as sounding-boards for the tone confined
within that cavity, we shut off the cavity, and
refuse the tone its natural reinforcement.
It takes on, as a result, a thin, unresonant
quality which we call nasal, although it is
thin and unpleasing because it lacks <i>true
nasal resonance</i>. The only remedy lies in
ceasing to shut off the cavity. Think the
sound &#862;oo. Let the tone on which it is to be
borne grow slowly in thought, filling, filling,
and, as it grows, flooding the whole face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
Let it press against your lips (in thought
only as yet), feel your nostrils expand, your
face grow alive between the eyes and the
upper lip, that area so often inanimate, lifeless,
even in a mobile, animated countenance.
Now let the sound come, but let it follow the
thought, flood the face, let the nostrils expand,
feel the nasal cavity fill with sound;
let it go on up into the head and strike the
forehead and the eye-sockets and the walls
of all the cavities so unused to the impact of
sound, which should never have been shut
out. Now begin, with lips closed, a humming
note, <i>m-m-m</i>. Let it come flooding
into the face, until it presses against the
lips, demanding the open mouth. Now let
it open the mouth into the <i>e</i>. Repeat this
over and over&mdash;<i>m-&#275;</i>, <i>m-&#275;</i>, <i>m-&#275;</i>. Don't let the
tone drop back as the mouth opens. Keep
it forward behind the upper lip, which it has
made full, and which, playing against, it
tickles until we <i>must</i> let the tone escape. Just
as much of the day as possible, think the
tone in a flood into the face, and as often as
possible hum and let it escape, noting its in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>creasing
resonance. It will increase in resonance,
I promise you. It will lose its thin,
high-pitched nasal quality, and grow mellow
and rich and ringing.</p>

<p>And so, with chest lifted, diaphragm at
work, throat open, tongue free, jaws relaxed,
and all the cavities concerned in vocalization
open to the tone, as you breathe and yawn
and hum, let it issue a full, round, resonant,
singing note to add itself to the music of the
world.</p>


<h4>A LAST WORD TO THE PUPIL</h4>

<p>Mr. William James tells us that we learn
to swim in winter and to skate in summer.
The principle underlying this statement is
of immense comfort in approaching a class
in vocal expression. The hope of satisfying
results is fostered by the knowledge
that a mere statement of the fundamental
facts of right tone production will
do much toward inducing a right condition
for tone. But I know, too, that immediate
results depend upon immediate and
faithful putting into practice of the principles
set forth. A little practice every day will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
work swift wonders with the voice. And
so, in leaving with you Madame Ricardo's
watchwords, I also commend you to Ellen
Terry's "infinite pains." When it means,
as it does in pursuing this ideal, that we must
be <i>on guard</i> every waking instant&mdash;<i>for a
time</i>; when it means a watch set (for a
time) upon every organ involved in expression&mdash;lips,
teeth, tongue, jaw, mouth,
throat, chest, diaphragm, and all the muscles
governing these organs; when it means a
watch set (for a time) upon one's every
thought and emotion lest it make false demands
upon the sensitive instruments of
their expression&mdash;then it becomes a daring
device, indeed, to wear upon one's crest.
Let us not hesitate to carve it there, when
we realize that to follow it means culture,
true culture, the culture which can only
come through control and command of one's
self.</p>


<h4>TO THE TEACHER</h4>

<p>When I consider how much depends in
the training of a voice upon listening to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
made tone, how little depends upon knowing
how it was made, I realize that it is <i>your ear</i>,
not my book, which must become the real
guide in this <i>Study of Vocal Expression</i>.</p>

Gant," concluded in 1576. It was a treaty of union
between Holland, Zealand, and the southern Netherlands,
against Spain, under tyrannical Philip II. The
treaty was greeted rapturously by the frontier cities,
because it was expected to free the Netherlands from
Spanish power.
</p><p>
"There is," writes Mr. Browning, "no sort of historical
foundation about 'Good News from Ghent.' I
wrote it under the bulwark of a vessel off the African
coast, after I had been at sea long enough to appreciate
even the fancy of a gallop on the back of a certain
good horse 'York,' then in my stable at home. It
was written in pencil on the fly-leaf of Bartoli's <i>Simboli</i>,
I remember."
</p><p>
While there is, then, no historical foundation for
the "gallop," the verisimilitude of the situation is perfect.
Aix might easily have resolved to set herself on
fire at a given hour, rather than submit herself and
her citizens piecemeal to the torch of the persecutor.
The "horse without peer" might possibly have galloped
the ninety-odd miles between Ghent and Aix,
but the feat would be a marvelous one.

This poem and "Herv&eacute; Riel," with the accompanying
notes, are reprinted from <i>Select Poems of Robert Browning</i>,
edited by William Rolfe, A.M., and H&eacute;loise E.
Hersey, and published by Harper &amp; Brothers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> "This spirited poem was sent to the <i>Cornhill</i>, because
Browning was asked for a subscription to the fund for
sending food to Paris after the siege by the Germans
in 1870-71. Though he condemned Louis Napoleon's
war, he wished to help the French in their distress, and
he sent to the fund the 100 pounds that Mr. George
Smith gave him for 'Herv&eacute; Riel.' The subject of the
poem and its generous treatment surely manifolded
the good-will of the gift. An English poet restored to
France its 'Forgotten Worthy.' An Englishman sang
the praises of a French sailor's balking the English
fleet. One of the nation whose boast it is that her
heroes need no other motive for their noble deeds than
'England expects every man to do his duty' showed
that in France, too&mdash;whose citizens were accused of
seeking glory and vainglory as their dearest gain&mdash;was
a man who could act out Nelson's words with no
thought of Nelson's end&mdash;a 'peerage or Westminster
Abbey'&mdash;but just do his duty because it lay before
him, and put aside with a smile the reward offered
him for doing it; a real man, an honor to the nation
and the navy of which he was part."
</p><p>
"The facts of the story had been forgotten and were
denied at St. Malo, but the reports to the French
Admiralty at the time were looked up and the facts
established. Browning's only alteration is that Herv&eacute;
Riel's holiday to see his wife, 'La Belle Aurore,' was
to last, not a day only, but his lifetime."
</p><p>
"Herv&eacute; Riel" was written at Le Croisic, the home of
the hero. It is a small fishing village near the mouth
of the Loire.</p></div>
